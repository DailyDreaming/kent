15 - Blast output seems to work, in the blat standalone.
14 - Starting to hack in blast output format. Added -trimHardA flag.
13 - Made things so that BLAT could find perfect 21mer matches
     fairly reliably.
12 - Put in fix from Darren Platt that cured crashes on
     protein/translated DNA alignments on Solaris.
11 - Fixed a bug that led to translated protein alignments coming
     back in multiple pieces.  This also caused small exons
     to sometimes be dropped.  Added -noTrimA flag
