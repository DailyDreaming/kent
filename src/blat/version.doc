19: 
     o  Switched blat from cgiSpoof to optionHash so that it can
        be called from a web page more easily.
     o  Adding -fastMap option.
     o  Making it able to take subsets of a nib file as input.
18: 
     o  Replaced super-stitcher dynamic program that generates 
        a table of size N*N times the number of blocks
        with a kdTree based program one that is much more space efficient 
        and a bit faster, especially in the worse cases.  This eliminates
        the 'warning trimming xxxx blocks to 7000' messages and
        fixes a crash bug manifesting specifically on the alpha
        archetecture as well.  It still uses the old routine when the
	number of blocks is less than 10.
     o  Made it so that it will find perfect 20-mers with tileSize=10.
     o  Fixed bug where it wasn't closing genome files, resulting in
        it only being able to process 250 files on the genome side
	on most systems.
     o  Fixed bug in sort gfHitSort2.  I'm amazed blat has worked
        as well as it has as long as it has with this bug!
     o  Put a 'Database: ' line at the end of the blast output to make
        bioperl happy.
     o  Fixed bug where you had to do -oneOff=1 rather than -oneOff
        in command line of blat.  
     o  Clarified makeOoc usage message.
     o  Made it handle fasta files with more than 64k of sequence
        in a single line.  
17 - Added -minScore -minIdentity and -prot command line options
     to gfClient.  gfClient uses same protein default minScore as 
     blat does. Made -mask=lower work with nib files in blat, 
     and -mask do the same thing in gfServer (though gfClient
     still won't fill in repMatches separately from matches).
     Made 'stdin' and 'stdout' work properly as parameters in
     place of files in the blat command line.
16 - Fixed case where program would abort with 'Negative gap size'
     message on some legitimate protein/translated alignments in modes
     using blast, wublast, axt, or maf output.   Fixed bug where
     nibFrag on minus strand would return usage message rather than running.
     Made blat store 'chr1' rather than '/long/path/to/chr1.nib' in
     name fields when input is a nib file.   Made pslPretty handle
     record separator lines of up to 1023 characters rather than 511.
15 - Blast output seems to work.  Also wublast, axt and maf output.
14 - Starting to hack in blast output format. Added -trimHardA flag.
13 - Made things so that BLAT could find perfect 21mer matches
     fairly reliably.
12 - Put in fix from Darren Platt that cured crashes on
     protein/translated DNA alignments on Solaris.
11 - Fixed a bug that led to translated protein alignments coming
     back in multiple pieces.  This also caused small exons
     to sometimes be dropped.  Added -noTrimA flag
