17 - Added -minScore -minIdentity and -prot command line options
     to gfClient.  gfClient uses same protein default minScore as 
     blat does. Made -mask=lower work with nib files in blat, 
     and -mask do the same thing in gfServer.
16 - Fixed case where program would abort with 'Negative gap size'
     message on some legitimate protein/translated alignments in modes
     using blast, wublast, axt, or maf output.   Fixed bug where
     nibFrag on minus strand would return usage message rather than running.
     Made blat store 'chr1' rather than '/long/path/to/chr1.nib' in
     name fields when input is a nib file.   Made pslPretty handle
     record separator lines of up to 1023 characters rather than 511.
15 - Blast output seems to work.  Also wublast, axt and maf output.
14 - Starting to hack in blast output format. Added -trimHardA flag.
13 - Made things so that BLAT could find perfect 21mer matches
     fairly reliably.
12 - Put in fix from Darren Platt that cured crashes on
     protein/translated DNA alignments on Solaris.
11 - Fixed a bug that led to translated protein alignments coming
     back in multiple pieces.  This also caused small exons
     to sometimes be dropped.  Added -noTrimA flag
