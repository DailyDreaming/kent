 8 (and before) - Getting basic index working to find probable hits.
 9 - Adding DNA sequence to index file.
10 - Starting to work on extending hits into alignments.  No indels seems to work.
11 - Making up a test case generator and some misc.
12 - Got middle two quadrant query insert case working.
13 - Got first quadrant query insert case working.
14 - Got last quadrant query insert case working.
15 - Middle two quadrants of query delete seem to work.
16 - Got last quadrant query insert case working.
17 - Got first quadrant query insert case working.
18 - Made it just output either an insertion or a deletion in the end quadrants, not both.
     Fixed off by one bug fix in last quadrant insert that caused an extra mismatch to be counted.
19 - Refactoring to have an intermediate list of matches in memory.
20 - Making it have tagAlign, maf, and psl output.  (Old style output is gone).
21 - Fixing a couple of bugs that reduced coverage in insert+sub and especially delete+sub
     cases.  Still a small bug (affecting ~2% of cases) in the delete+sub case.
