Here are the binary and unary operations allowed by ParaFlow 
listed in order of precedence:

Prec.	Symbol	Function
------------------------
1	!	Logical not
1	~	Bitwise not
1	-	Unary minus
2	*	Multiplication
2	/	Division
2	%	Modulo (remainder after division)
2	<<	Bitwise shift left
2	>>	Bitwise shift right
2	&	Bitwise and
3	+	Addition.  String concatenation.
3	-	Subtraction.
3	|	Bitwise or.
3	^	Bitwise xor.
4	==	Logical equality (as opposed to assignment)
4	!=	Logical not equals
4	>=	Greater than or equals
4	<=	Less than or equals
4	>	Greater than
4	<	Less than
5	,	Separate items on a list
6	=	Assignment. Set variable equal to a value.

Function calls and array indexing is performed at a higher 
level of precedence than any of these.
