O) Check that para stuff works on objects.  Allow writes to self.

1) Eliminate need for type in constructs like
       (type element in collection)

2) Implement array.append pseudo-method.

3) Implement dimensioning of multi-dimensional arrays as in:
      array[8] of array[8] of square checkerboard;

4) Implement flow checking (no use of globals at all).

5) Make it so that there's a para function that returns the key as well
   as the value for max and min.

6) Allow a tuple of expressions all of the same type to be used
   in a para expression.   Arrange it so that each expression in the
   tuple is evaluated in parallel:
        (double a,b,c) = para (double i in (sqrt(2), sin(2), cos(2)) get

And larger projects:

A) Rip out reference counting.
B) Make para actions use p-threads.
C) Put in "coalesce and copy on return" style memory
   management that makes heavy use of stack.
