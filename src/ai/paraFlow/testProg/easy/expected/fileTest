There are 10 numbers and 26 letters.
The letters are abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
The numbers are 0123456789
Every other number and letter: 13579bdfhjlnprtvxz
The last five letters are vwxyz
I've got 30 punctuation marks:  ~!@#$%^&*()_+=-}{,./?.,;:'"\|`
I like upper case better too.
0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ~!@#$%^&*()_+=-}{,./?.,;:'"\|`
That's better, it's more like Perl now.
Let's start over.
How does this look?
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789KLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Ok, I'm done now.
