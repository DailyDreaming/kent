Installing the UCSC Genome browser

The instructions here are similar to the Mirror site instructions at:
	http://genome.ucsc.edu/admin/mirror.html
	with the exception of downloading the databases.

The example setup here will install a single-organism database
to get the browser started.  Additional organism databases can
be added after the browser is installed and functioning.
The example mysql user here is: "browser" with a password of: "genome"

1.  Confirm the following:
	a. Apache WEB server is installed and working
		http://localhost/
	    Provides the Apache default home page from your machine
	b. MySQL database is installed and working
		$ mysql -pgenome -e 'show tables;' mysql
	    MySQL can be run from the command line, and
	    the tables from the database mysql can be displayed.
        c. MySQL development package is installed (mysql-devel)
	    The directory: /usr/include/mysql/ has the mysql .h files
	    And the library: /usr/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.a exists
	    (your exact pathnames may vary depending upon your installation)

2.  Mount the CD-ROM if it isn't already:
	mount /mnt/cdrom
	Set CDROM to its path for commands to follow
	CDROM=/mnt/cdrom
	export CDROM

3.  Set MySQL database access permissions.  The examples mentioned
	in the README.mysql.setup.txt instructions will allow this
	setup to function as described here.

	To setup the example user accounts as mentioned in these
	instructions, run the script:

	${CDROM}/example/MySQLUserPerms.sh

4.  Find the location of your Apache WEB server DocumentRoot
	and cgi-bin directory.
	Typical locations are:  /var/www and /usr/local/apache
		/var/www/html
		/var/www/cgi-bin
	The directory where these are located is referred to as
	WEBROOT in this documentation:
		WEBROOT=/var/www
		export WEBROOT
	The browser WEB pages and cgi-bin binaries expect these
	two directories to be next to each other in ${WEBROOT}
	since referrals in html are often: "../cgi-bin"

	Please note, at this time there are several hard-coded root
	pathways in the browser CGI binaries that require them
	to reside in Apache's WEBROOT hierarchy in order to function.
	Until these path names are corrected, the browser will
	only function in this location.

5.  Create html, cgi-bin and trash directories:
	mkdir ${WEBROOT}/html
	mkdir ${WEBROOT}/cgi-bin
	chmod 755 ${WEBROOT}/cgi-bin
	(this chmod 755 will prevent suexec failures that are indicated
	    by "Premature end of script headers" errors in the Apache
	    error_log.  Your cgi binaries should also be 755 permissions.)

	mkdir ${WEBROOT}/trash
	chmod 777 ${WEBROOT}/trash
	ln -s ${WEBROOT}/trash  ${WEBROOT}/html/trash

	A cron job should be set to periodically clean the files in trash.
	Please note the example at ${CDROM}/example/CleanTrash.sh

	The browser creates .gif files in the trash directory.
	The 'chmod 777' allows the Apache WEB server to write into
	that directory.

6.  Copy static WEB page content:
	cp -Rp ${CDROM}/webrootHTML/* ${WEBROOT}/html

7.  Copy CGI binaries:
	cp -p ${CDROM}/built_CGI-BIN/* ${WEBROOT}/cgi-bin

	These binaries were built on a Red Hat Linux release 7.3
	with gcc version 2.96
	If they do not function on your Red Hat system you may need
	to rebuild them from the source tree.

8.  Create hgcentral database and tables.  This is the primary gateway
	database that allows the browser to find specific organism
	databases.

	mysql -pgenome -e "create database hgcentral;"
	mysql -pgenome hgcentral < ${CDROM}/example/hgcentral.sql

	Please note, it is possible to create alternative hgcentral
	databases.  For example, for test purposes.  In this
	case use a unique name for the hgcentral database, such
	as "hgcentraltest", and it can be specified in the hg.conf
	file as mentioned in the next step.  To create a second copy
	of the hgcentral database:

	mysql -pgenome -e "create database hgcentraltest;"
	mysql -pgenome hgcentraltest < ${CDROM}/example/hgcentral.sql

9.  Create the hg.conf file in ${WEBROOT}/cgi-bin/hg.conf
	to allow the CGI binaries to find the hgcentral database
	(or specifically named hgcentraltest for example)

	Copy the sample hg.conf:
	cp ${CDROM}/example/hg.conf ${WEBROOT}/cgi-bin

	Adjust the db.user,db.password, central.user and
	central.password entries.
	The central.db entry specifies the hgcentral database.
	Adjust this name if you are using a different name
	for hgcentral.  Set the central.domain to your machine's
	network domain name.  This will allow the browser
	cookie-cart function to work.

	Browser developers will want a copy of this file in
	their home directory with mode 600 and named:
		~/.hg.conf
	These copies may have different db.user specification
	to allow developers write access to the database.

10.  Copy the sample C. briggsae organism database and generic
	hgFixed database text files:
	
	cp -Rp ${CDROM}/goldenPath ${WEBROOT}/html

11.  Copy the gbdb data to /gbdb
	The directory /gbdb is a location where the browser finds
	large data files that do not conveniently fit into the
	database.  This directory can be a symlink to a filesystem
	other than root where data space is available.
	A fully loaded genome browser with all databases can occupy
	more than 200 Gb of data.  This example requires only 200 Mb

	GBDB=/<filesystem with 200 Mb space available>
	export GBDB
	mkdir ${GBDB}/gbdb
	ln -s ${GBDB}/gbdb /gbdb
	cp -Rp ${CDROM}/gbdb /${GBDB}

12.  Load the hgFixed database (a database common to all organisms)

	mysql -pgenome -e "create database hgFixed;"
	cd ${WEBROOT}/html/goldenPath/hgFixed/database

	# Create tables in hgFixed:
	for file in *.sql
	do
		mysql -pgenome hgFixed < $file
	done
	# Load the data into the tables:
	for file in *.txt.gz
	do
		FN=`echo $file | sed -e "s/.gz//"`
		echo "working on $file"
		gunzip $file
		mysqlimport -pgenome hgFixed $FN
		echo "imported $FN"
		gzip $FN &
	done

	Note that last gzip is in the background to allow processing
	of the next file to proceed while previous files are gzipped
	back to their original state.  This process consumes quite
	a bit of time.

13.  Load the example C. briggsae organism database.

	mysql -pgenome -e "create database cb1;"
	cd ${WEBROOT}/html/goldenPath/cbJul2002/database
	# Create tables in cb1:
	for file in *.sql
	do
		mysql -pgenome cb1 < $file
	done
	# Load the data into the tables:
	for file in *.txt.gz
	do
		FN=`echo $file | sed -e "s/.gz//"`
		echo "working on $file"
		gunzip $file
		mysqlimport -pgenome cb1 $FN
		echo "imported $FN"
		gzip $FN &
	done

	Note that last gzip is in the background to allow processing
	of the next file to proceed while previous files are gzipped
	back to their original state.  This process consumes quite
	a bit of time.

14.  The browser should now appear at the URL:
	http://localhost/

	Check your Apache error_log file for hints to solving problems.

15.  Known problems:

	Since there is no C. elegans database loaded, the chained
	tracks from this C. briggsae example browser will not
	click through to the C. elegans browser.

	The "Convert" function link in the blue bar at the top
	of the browser will not work because of missing genomes
	for the Convert to work with.

	The "Downloads" page: /downloads.html lists all the
	genomes available at genome.ucsc.edu
	Only the cb1 genome is available in this sample installation.

	A cron job mechanism to keep the trash directory clean over
	time has not been described.  Users should implement a
	cron job to periodically remove files from trash.

        src/lib/log.c optionally uses syslog to support logging
        by parasol and gfServer. This is not required for these
        programs to function.  Older implementions of syslog 
        may not have the vsyslog() function.  If you gets errors,
        add -DNO_SYSLOG to the HG_DEFS line in inc/common.mk.
