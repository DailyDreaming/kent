Included here are some scripts to help with the job of constructing
and maintaining a mirror site for the UCSC Genome Browser.

These scripts are helpful and useful, but they are not the entire
story.

They expect that commands for rsync, cvs, and mysql, for example,
are installed on your system.  Instructions for the installation
of MySQL and the Apache WEB server are not included here.
Those products have excellent How-To resources on the internet.

You must copy and edit the specification file:

	browserEnvironment.txt

to determine where the various objects are going to exist on
your system.  The examples in that file are sending files to
/scratch/tmp/ which is probably not very useful.  You can copy
this file to a file name of your choice and edit that file.
The pathname to that file will be used with these scripts so
they understand how to function in your environment.

The difference between "full" and "minimal" in the scripts.
A "minimal" set of files for a given UCSC genome database are
sufficient to get a genome browser up and running with no
extra tracks.  This genome browser will have no annotations.
The "full" set of files for a given genome browser are all files
required to operate that genome browser with all annotation tracks
available.  The sizes of the larger databases are becoming more
that 1 Tb.

Brief description of these scripts.  Run them with no arguments
to view their full help messages:

1. activeDbList.sh - using MySQL commands to the public UCSC MySQL
	server, will fetch a list of active databases.  Lists of
	databases can be used with some of the fetch and load scripts.
2. minimal.db.list.txt - a list of active databases as of mid-March 2010
3. kentSrcUpdate.sh - fetches and/or updates a local copy of the 'kent'
	source tree and builds that source tree with resulting binaries
	into directories of your specification in your copy of the
	browserEnvironment.txt file.  Requires the use of the
	beta.cvsup.pl script.
4. beta.cvsup.pl - used by kentSrcUpdate.sh to run a 'cvs up' command on
	an existing 'kent' source tree.
5. fetchHgCentral.sh - fetches a copy of the hgcentral.sql definition of
	the hgcentral database
6. updateHtml.sh - rsync fetch the static HTML hierarchy of
	the UCSC Genome Browser into your specified documentRoot
7. fetchMinimalGbdb.sh - rsync fetch of a minimal set of files in the /gbdb/
	hierarchy to operate a genome browser with the smallest set of files
8. fetchMinimalGoldenPath.sh - rsync fetch of a minimal set of files in the
	goldenPath/ hierarchy to be used to load a genome datase
9. loadDb.sh - can perform an initial load of a database from the
	goldenPath/ database MySQL text dumps
10. fetchFullGbdb.sh - rsync fetch of all files for a given database into
	the local /gbdb/ hierarchy
11. fetchFullGoldenPath.sh - rsync fetch of all files for a given database
	into the local goldenPath/ database MySQL text dump directory
