# trackDb table to use. A simple value of `trackDb' is normally sufficient.
# In general, the value is a comma-separated list of trackDb format tables to
# search.  This supports local tracks combined with a mirror of the trackDb
# table from UCSC. The names should be in the form `trackDb_suffix'. This
# implies a parallel hgFindSpec format search table exists in the form
# hgFindSpec_suffix.  The specified trackDb tables are searched in the order
# specified, with the first occurance of a track being used.  You may associate
# trackDb/hgFindSpec tables with other instances of genome databases using a
# specification of profile:trackDbTbl, where profile is the name of a
# databases profile in hg.conf, and trackDbTbl is the name of the table in the
# remote databases.

#  New browser function as of April 2007, custom track data is kept
#	in a database instead of in trash files.  This function requires
#	several other factors to be in place before it will work.
#  In this first implementation, this is an optional feature, but
#	approximately by the end of the year 2007, this will be required.
#
#	See also:

#	tmpdir of /data/tmp is the default location if not specified here
#	Set this to a directory as recommended in the genomewiki
#	discussion mentioned above.
