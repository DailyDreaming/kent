Specification of the Multiple Alignment Format (.maf) v1

Introduction

The multiple alignment format stores a series of multiple
alignments in a format that is easy to parse and relatively
easy to read.  We apologize for creating yet another
multiple alignment format.  We realize that there are
many in existence.  What motivates this format is
the storage multiple alignments at the dna level between
entire genomes. The existing formats we are aware of
are geared towards multiple alignments of single proteins,
and would require considerable extension at the least to
cope with genomic issues such as forward and reverse
strand directions,  multiple pieces to the alignment,
and so forth.

A Simple Example

Here is a simple example of a file with two alignments
with three sequences each:

##maf version=1 scoring=multiz
#mblastz 8.91 02-Jan-2005
a score=0.128
s human_hoxa 100  9 + 100257 ACA-TTACT
s horse_hoxa 120 10 -  98892 ACAATTGCT
s fugu_hoxa   88  8  + 90788 ACA--TGCT

a score=0.071
s human_unc 9077 8 + 10998 ACAGTATT
s horse_unc 4555 6 -  5099 ACA--ATT
s fugu_unc  4000 4 +  4038 AC----TT


General Structure

The .maf format is line oriented. Multiple alignments each
end with a blank line.  Each sequence in an alignment 
is on a single line, which can get quite long. Lines 
starting with # are considered comments.  Lines starting 
with ## can be ignored by most programs, but contain 
meta-data of one form or another.  

Each non-comment line within a multiple alignment begins
with a type word.  Currently only types 'a' and 's' are
defined.   Alignments begin with an 'a' line, which is
followed by an arbitrary number of 's' lines.  Parsers
should ignore lines starting with other type words for now.


The First Line

The first line of a .maf file begins with ##maf.  This
word is followed by whitespace separated name/value pairs.  
A version name/value pair is required


The 'a' Lines

Each alignment begins with an 'a' line.
