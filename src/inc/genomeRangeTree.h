/* genomeRangeTree - This module is a way of keeping track of
 * non-overlapping ranges (half-open intervals) across a whole
 * genome (multiple chromosomes or scaffolds). 
 * It is a hash table container mapping chrom to rangeTree.
 * Most of the work is performed by rangeTree, this container
 * enables local memory and stack to be shared by many rangeTrees
 * so it should be able to handle genomes with a very large 
 * number of scaffolds. See rangeTree for more information. */
