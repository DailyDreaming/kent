test
----
This directory is for scripts to do basic sanity checks on the 
databases (e.g. hg10) and/or CGI "scripts" (hgTracks, hgc, 
hgTrackUi, hgBlat, hgConvCoords, hgText).  

Contents
--------
perllib/:
 - Contains Perl packages for test scripts: TrackDb.pm and WebTest.pm .

hgTest.pl:
 - parameterizable test script for hg* CGI tools.  
   Run "hgTest.pl -help" for a description of command line args.

getTracks.pl:
 - prints out the trackName column from the trackDb table from 
   several databases (hg7, hg8, hg10).  This is intended just as 
   a simple test for perllib/TrackDb.pm.  





Test Strategy
-------------
- connect to trackDb, get trackName column (list of trackNames)
- exercise features on each trackName in each CGI "script".  

Parameters
----------
Useful parameters for testing:
- host: web server (database server??)
- database (hg10, mm1 etc)  [doh -- mm1's trackDb has tableName not trackName!]
- cookies & session id?
- randomize?  how many queries?
- sleep delay between requests?
