1 - lost in the mists of time
2 - beyond the reach of our records
3 - a version that spanned many recompiles.  Sometimes was stable.
4 - fixed problem where nodes would be marked as dead if they
    took longer than 10 minutes to run a job.
5 - Added logic to cope more gracefully with nodes that are 
    running jobs but momentarily can't be reached by hub.
6 - Changing paraHub from processes to threads, and from TCP/IP
    to UDP.  Separating out node port and hub port so that same
    machine can run node and hub daemons.  Fixing bug where
    it would crash when you did a 'parasol remove jobs user'.
