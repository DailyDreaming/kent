 1 - Lost in the mists of time
 
 2 - Beyond the reach of our records
 
 3 - A version that spanned many recompiles.  Sometimes was stable.
 
 4 - Fixed problem where nodes would be marked as dead if they
     took longer than 10 minutes to run a job.
     
 5 - Added logic to cope more gracefully with nodes that are 
     running jobs but momentarily can't be reached by hub.
     
 6 - Changing paraHub from processes to threads, and from TCP/IP
     to UDP.  Separating out node port and hub port so that same
     machine can run node and hub daemons.  Fixing bug where
     it would crash when you did a 'parasol remove jobs user'.
     
 7 - Some changes on paraNode to hopefully make it harder for
     a node to lose track of the jobs it is running.  Using
     waitpid() rather than wait, and eliminating the clearZombies().
     
 8 - Made paraHub just warn rather than abort on failure to close
     a results file cleanly.  Also changed auto-close time to
     1 minute rather than 5.
     
 9 - Added good/bad count to machine struct. 
     Changed logging to use syslog.
     Corrected setting of user's groups for better security.
     
10 - Added priorities to batches. Added para status command.
     Changed paraNode to only do SU when running as root,
     so that stand-alone single user testing works.
     Also changed happy dots so it only outputs them if going
     to a terminal, not a file or emacs shell buffer.
     Added host as penultimate column in paraJobStatus display.

     Fixed bug in paraNode err msg when fetching a file not found.
     Fixed bug in paraNode during hub startup which corrupted para.results.
     Fixed bug in paraHub causing crash when using priorities.
     Made paraHub into a proper daemon which is better for normal usage.
     Added -log=path/logfile to paraHub and paraNode so that users
     debugging without admin priveleges can see output.
     Added -debug option to paraHub so it won't demonize for debugging.

11 - Added estimated completion time to para. -eta for time function.
     Added -maxNode to limit number of nodes a batch can have.
     Added longest running job to para time output and renamed
     longest job to longest finished job.
