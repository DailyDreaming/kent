LOADING DATA INTO VISIGENE

To load images into VisiGene we need three types of files.
  1) The images themselves, preferably in JPEG format, but
     we can convert from TIFF and most other formats as well.
  2) A file in what we call a .ra format that describes things
     that are common to all the images in a group.  
  3) A tab-separated text file that contains one line for each
     image in the submission.
In general the loading system is flexible whether information goes
in the .ra file or in the tab separated file.  

Optionally there will be a fourth file that contains information
about the expression levels observed in various anatomical parts
according to the image(s).

OVERVIEW OF .RA and .TAB FILES

The input to visiGeneLoad is a .ra file and a tab-separated file.
Both .ra and .tab files contain tagged values.  In the .ra file the tag 
is the first word of a line, and the rest of the line is the value.  Note that
blank lines are *not* allowed in the .ra file.   In the tab-separated
file the tags for each column are contained in the first row,  which
should start with a '#' character, and then contain the column names
in a tab-separated manner.  Subsequent rows contain the values for
a particular image.  The program creates the database first by looking
for fields in the tab-separated file,  and then in the .ra file.

REQUIRED FIELD IN .RA FILE

contributor - A comma separate list of contributers.  Each contributer is of
    the form last name followed by initials.  There is a period, but no space
    after each initial.  Example:  Kent W.J., Haussler D., van Braun W.S.D
submitSet - name of submission set.

REQUIRED FIELD IN .TAB FILE

fileName - The name of the image file (not including directory).  
submitId - an ID to substitute into itemUrl for image.

REQUIRED FIELDS THAT CAN BE IN EITHER .RA or .TAB FILE

fullDir - The directory where the full-sized version of image lives.
screenDir - Directory where the screen-sized version of image lives.
thumbDir - Directory where thumbnail-sized version of image lives.
age - days since conception embryo.
probeColor - color of probe.
taxon - NCBI taxon of organism in image.
