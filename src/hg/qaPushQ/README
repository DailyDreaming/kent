add support for multiple species
Bob says that an entire queue can 
run for things with the same database.
If this is true, I need to modify the 
code for maintaining rank and filtering.
Plus provide a way for people to select 
and change between databases.  
Then would they still be able to see all at once?

cron job to backup hgsqldump the qapushq database on beta.
dev will have just a testing version for the new stuff.

add &cacheDefeat=random to URL and db to suppress back-button problems if any.

just give in and use the cart

monthly reports in easy-to-use format
add ability to query old logs more fully (later)

revision 1.1
date: 2004/04/21 20:24:36;  author: galt;  state: Exp;
Added cgi program qaPushQ to maintain the Push Queue for ucsc genome project.
hg.conf has new "pq."-entries.
Program goes in cgi-bin.
Uses db qapushq with tables pushQ and users.
New user qauser on dev and beta
Allows PushQ records to be entered and edited.
Columns can be re-arranged or hidden. Rows can be prioritized.
 
Users must login and if password is blank in qapushq.users, it stores
an MD5 hash of the password using extended linux crypt(3), becoming the new password.
  
When pushing, it checks to make sure that joiner, index, and makedoc
have been verified, and that the size field is not blank.
   
Currently users must be added manually to the database:
hgsql qapushq
insert into users values ('newname','','','','');
To clear the password:
update users set password='' where user='theuser';
To empty the pseudo-cart:
update users set content='' where user='theuser';
