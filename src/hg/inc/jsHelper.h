/* jsHelper - some little helper routines  to manage our javascript.  
 * We don't do much javascript - just occassionally use it so that
 * when they select something from a pull-down, it will go hit the server to 
 * figure out how to reload other control options based on the choice.
 * (For instance if they change the group, which items in the track
 * drop-down need to change).
 *
 * We accomplish this by maintaining two forms - a mainForm and a
 * hiddenForm.  The hiddenForm maintains echo's of all the variables
 * in the main form, which get updated onChange of controls that need
 * to 'ripple' to other controls.  The onChange also submits the
 * control. */
