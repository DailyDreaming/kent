Hi Daryl,
Thanks for your detailed answer. I am trying to solve this "puzzle" for
long. It really helps a lot

Circe,

I apologize for the delay - I was on vacation until today.  The short
answer is that SNPs have varying degrees of reliability, and there is a
filtering process that removes untrustworthy data.  Please see below for a
more complete description of the filtering process.

Initially, dbSNP contains all of the publicly available SNPs, including
the TSC SNPs.  New builds of dbSNP are created either as new genomic
assemblies become available or as newly deposited SNP data is mapped.

The data from dbSNP is first filtered, then divided into one of two
categories:

Random Reads:  Shows locations of SNPs detected by aligning reads
from random genomic clones from a diverse pool of human DNA
against the genome.  (snpTsc table)

Clone Overlaps:  Shows locations of SNPs detected primarily by
looking at overlaps between clones that cover the same region of
the genome.  (snpNih table)

========================================================================
Filtering of dbSNP data for UCSC SNP tracks.

The SNPs on this page include all of the polymorphisms that can be mapped
against the current assembly.  This includes known point mutations (Single
Nucleotide Polymorphisms), insertions, deletions, and segmental mutations
from the current build of dbSNP.  There are three major cases that are not
mapped and/or annotated:

  a. Submissions that are completely masked as repetitive
elements. These are dropped from any further computations. This set of
refSNPs are dumped in chromosome "rs_chMasked" on the dbSNP ftp site.

b. Submissions that are defined in a cDNA context with extensive
splicing. These SNPs are typically annotated on refseq mRNAs through a
separate annotation process. Effort is being made to reverse map these
variations back to contig coordinates, but that has not been
implemented. For now, you can find this set of variations in
"rs_chNotOn" on the dbSNP ftp site.

c. Submissions with excessive hits to the genome. Variations with
3+ hits to the genome are not included in the tracks, but are available in
"rs_chMulti" on the dbSNP ftp site.

The heuristics for the non-SNP variations (i.e. named elements and STRs)
are quite conservative so some of these are probably lost. This approach
was chosen to avoid false annotation of variation in inappropriate
locations.

The dbSNP ftp site can be found at <ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/human/>.
========================================================================

The difference between the full TSC dataset and the subset we display on
the genome browser is due to this filtering process.  SNPs that do not
appear on the browser have been filtered out for one of the reasons listed
here.  If you need to see the details of the remaining SNPs, the dbSNP FTP
site is the best place to get the unprocessed data.

It is true that the mapping can change slightly between NCBI and UCSC
assemblies.  Sometimes there have been contigs that are oriented
incorrectly in the NCBI build.  This is determined at UCSC by a consensus
of cytogenetic markers, so we flip the contigs.  The annotations are also
inverted, creating what we believe is a better approximation of the real
genomic sequence.

In summary, i) the highest quality TSC (random read) and NIH (clone
overlap) SNPs are available in the SNP tracks on the UCSC genome browser.
ii) SNPs that do not map well to the current assembly are withheld, as
they are considered false positives, but they are still available from
dbSNP.  iii) Some minor mapping differences exist between the UCSC and
NCBI assemblies.

I hope these are the answers you were seeking.  Please let me know if you
have further SNP-related questions, or <genome@soe.ucsc.edu> for general
browser questions.
