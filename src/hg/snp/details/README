TODO: modify getObsHet to process mutations other than single nucleotide polymorphisms

fixed getObsHet to reflect changes in the ncbi dbSnp DTD structure

download the XML files (ftp ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/human/XML/*) ( about 80 minutes )
edit runall.csh to update filenames (should be command-line parameters)
make directories (done; chN.observed; supplemental)
make links to previous build for human and mouse
nohup nice time ./runall.csh >& log &  ( about 90 minutes )
mysql> delete from dbSnpRS;
mysql> load data local infile "dbSnpOutput13" into table dbSnpRS; 
gzip dbSnpOutputHg13 

remember to re-load the mouse AND human details
