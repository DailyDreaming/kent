*) README

*) encodeTimeline.py
   Now a cgi-bin python script.

   Notes: Uses the 2.6 version of python 
            #!/hive/groups/recon/local/bin/python
          Requires the gviz_api.py library

*) Deprecated - encodeTimeline.py [No longer a command-line program]

Run the program:
  $ encodeTimeline.py > timeline.html

  The program has hard-coded paths for 
    the report directory
    the important dates file

  The program finds the most recent report file, parses it and
  outputs an html file where the data is stored statically via Javascript.

*) Deprecated Instructions using old Perl script

Run the program:

  $ encodeChart.pl newreport.2010-03-31.dcc.txt important.dates.tab > tab.out

Logon to: http://docs.google.com

Open the file: ENCODE Cumulative Submit and Release

Copy and paste file "tab.out" into the spreadsheet

Chart should be automatically updated
