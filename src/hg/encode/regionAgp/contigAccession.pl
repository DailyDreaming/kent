# Extract WGS contig to accession mapping from Entrez Nucleotide summaries
# Outputs to STDOUT, one line per mapping, in the format:
#       <contig>\t<accession>

# To get the summary file, access the Genbank page for the project by searching:
#       genus[ORGN] AND WGS[KYWD]
# At the end of the page, click on the list of accessions for the contigs.
# Select summary format, and send to file.
# The format of the summaries and the contig naming convention
# differs for each project
