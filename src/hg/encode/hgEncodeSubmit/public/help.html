Data is submitted to the ENCODE DCC as a 
compressed archive of files.
This archive consists of data files, together with
metadata files
describing the data files.  Each ENCODE project will work 
with the ENCODE DCC to create a data agreement that specifies 
the data file and metadata file formats for their project.
<p>
Once the data agreement is finalized, data is submitted
as follows:
<ul>
<li> Create a project
<li> Submit the submission archive to the project
<li> Verify that the submission was accepted
<li> When notified by the DCC, approve the track(s) in the browser
</ul>
If the project submission fails, create an archive
containing corrected versions of any problem files, 
and submit this to the project.  
If any failure messages are unclear, 
<A HREF="/contact.html">contact the DCC</A> for assistance.
