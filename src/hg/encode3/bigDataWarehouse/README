Here lies code to implement the ENCODE Big Data Warehouse (BDW).  The BDW is designed to track 
a moderate number (100,000's) of big (~1GB) files.  It consists of three parts:
1) A Linux file system with a fairly large block size.
2) A MySQL database with a relatively small number of tables tracking
    a) Users (by their email name)
    b) Hubs (by their URLs)
    c) Hosts (by their IP and connectivity)
    d) Submissions (by date/submitter/hub)
    e) Files (by hub file name and BDW license plate).
    f) Subscribers (jobs that get started when a file of a particular type arrives).
3) A system to notify subscribers when a file has been recieved.

Note the pipeline code is relatively separate.  The pipeline subscribes to the big data warehouse.
