This directory contains stuff for the composite custom tracks.  A composite custom track is a 
binary file which lives predominantly on the user's machine.  It is set up so that a minimum
amount of information for a particular genomic view needs to be sent.

The overall structure of the file is:

Fixed size file header
   Magic number
   Header size
   Version
   Assembly id (hg18, etc)
Table of contents and metadata
   Track1
      name, parent name
      settings (name/value ascii pairs)
      zoom info
         zoom level (1 for full)
	 file offset
   Track2 
      ...
Track1 Data
   Full resolution 
       index
       data
   Zoomed out 
       index
       data
Track2 Data
    ...

The table of contents and metadata are small enough to fit into memory and to be sent in most 
cases with the first block of the file.
