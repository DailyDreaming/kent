#This describes how at least some of the tables in
#hgFixed were created.  This is a database containing
#primarily expression data.  There are two main formats:
#  expRecord.as - This describes the mRNA sources for
#     a series of microarray experiments 
#  expData.as - This describes the measured value 
#     in either absolute or relative ratio terms of
#     each gene/probe/target in a series of microarray
#     experiments.  Each expData is associated with
#     an expRecord, thogh expDatas sometimes share
#     the same expRecord.

#The Human Affy GNF Expression Atlas 2003 Version:
# Create the main expRecord table and the expData table for
# the absolute measurements as so:
hgGnfMicroarray gnfHumanU95Exps gnfHumanU95All /projects/compbio/data/microarray/affyGnfHuman/data_public_U95
# Convert these to ratios using the median of medians of non-cancerous
# cell types as the denominator as so:
cd ~/src/hg/makeDb/hgRatioMicroarray
hgRatioMicroarray gnfHumanU95All gnfHumanU95AllRatio -clump=gnfClump.ra
# Take the median value over multiple replicants and put in this table:
cd ../hgMedianMicroarray
hgMedianMicroarray hgFixed gnfHumanU95AllRatio gnfHumanU95Exps gnfU95Median.ra gnfHumanU95MedianRatio gnfHumanU95MedianExps -minExps=1
