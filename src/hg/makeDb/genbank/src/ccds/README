Import of CCDS (Consensus CDS) into browser database.

Dumps of the CCDS database are in at:

     ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/hcds/Hs35.1/CDSTrackDB/

named in the form:
        CCDS.20050303.tar.gz

Initially, import is done manually, later this maybe be
automated to be part of the genbank updates.


Import database:

The CCDS schema from NCBI, which I believe is Sybase, is
converted to MySQL in a semi-manual fashion.  The directory
ncbiSql contains the last NCBI sql files imported:

   createTables.sql
   createKeys.sql

After determining what has changed in the NCBI SQL files, copy them
to ncbiSql and convert them to MySQL with:

   ncbiSql/convertCreateTables ncbiSql/createTables.sql > createTables.sql
   ncbiSql/convertCreateKeys ncbiSql/createKeys.sql > createKeys.sql

result of the conversion are checked-in to CVS.  These programs may
have to be modified if the schema changes.

The program ccdsImport imports the table dumps into a database ccds,
which is then used to generate the tables that are loaded into
the hgdb..


hgdb tables created are:
       ccdsGene - genePred track for CCDS
       ccdsInfo - cross-reference information for CCDS.
