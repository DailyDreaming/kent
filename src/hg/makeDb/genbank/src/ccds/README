Import of CCDS (Consensus CDS) into browser database.

A simplified dump of the CCDS dataset is available:

      ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/hcds/Hs35.1/MatchData/

This is currently used to build the UCSC tracks.  A full dump of the 
CCDS database is at:

     ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/hcds/Hs35.1/CDSTrackDB/

Initially, import is done manually, later this maybe be automated to
be part of the genbank updates.

Primary file of interest is NcbiHinxtonAllAccessions.txt.

Tables created from this file:
       ccdsGene - genePred track for CCDS
       ccdsInfo - cross-reference information for CCDS.
