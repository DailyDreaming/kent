Import of CCDS (Consensus CDS) into browser database.

Dumps of the CCDS database are in at:

     ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/hcds/Hs35.1/CDSTrackDB/

named in the form:
        CCDS.20050303.tar.gz

Initially, import is done manually, later this maybe be
automated to be part of the genbank updates.


Import database:

The CCDS schema from NCBI, which I believe is Sybase, is
converted to MySQL in a semi-manual fashion.  The directory
ncbiSql contains the last NCBI sql files imported:

   createTables.sql
   createKeys.sql

The script ncbiSql/convertCreateTables, converts createTables.sql to
MySQL.  The file createKeys.sql is not currently converted,
since we don't setup foreign key constraints and all required
indices will come out of the createTables conversion.  The
result of the conversion is checked-in as createTables.sql
in this directory.  If the schema changes, it will need
to be converted by hand.


The program ccdsImport imports the table dumps into a database ccds,
which is then used to generate the tables that are loaded into
the hgdb..


hgdb tables created are:
       ccdsGene - genePred track for CCDS
       ccdsInfo - cross-reference information for CCDS.
