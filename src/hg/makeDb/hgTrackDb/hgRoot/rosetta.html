<i>Nature</i> vol 409 pp 922-7 for more information. Rosetta created DNA probes for
each exon as described by the Sanger center for the October 2000 draft of the genome.
Exons are labeled according whether they are predicted (pe) or confirmed (true->te) exons, the
relative position in the genome, and the contig name. <b>Please note:</b> in the browser 
window the hybridization names are too long to fit and have been abbreviated.

<h3>Display Options</h3>
The track can be configured with a few different options:

<br><b>Reference Sample: </b> This option is only valid when the track is displayed in
full. It determines how the 69 different experiments are displayed. The
options are:
<ul>
<li><b>All Experiments: </b> Display the data for each experiment one
   row per experiment.</li>
<li><b>Common Reference and Other:</b> Displays a summary value for all the
   experiments done with a common pooled reference sample, and another summary value for 
   the rest of the experiments.</li>
<li><b>Common Pool:</b> Only displays experiments which were performed using a 
   common pooled reference sample.</li>
<li><b>Other:</b> Only displays experiments which were not performed using a common
   pooled reference sample.</li>
</ul>

<b>Exons Shown: </b> Probes on the microarrays correspond to gene
predictions on chromosome 22, some of which were confirmed by known
genes, others are predictions. This option determines whether data is
shown for probes corresponding to confirmed, predicted, or all exons
are shown.

<br><b>Color Scheme: </b> Data are presented using two color false display. By default
the Brown/Botstein colors of red -> positive log ratio, green -> negative log ratio are used.
However, blue can be substituted for green for those who are color blind.

<h3>Details Page</h3>
On the details page the probes presented correspond to those contained
in window range seen on the Genome Browser, the exon probe selected is highlighted
in blue. The detail display table is actually an average of many data
points. It is possible to see the full data for each experiment
graphically by select the check-boxes for the experiments of interest
and clicking the submit value button.
