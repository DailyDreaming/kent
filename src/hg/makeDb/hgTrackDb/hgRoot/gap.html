This track depicts gaps in the assembly.  These gaps will, with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic gaps, be closed during the
finishing process.  Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is known, it is a 'bridged' gap, and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap.  There are four principle 
types of gaps:
<UL>
  <LI>Fragment - gaps between the contigs of a draft clone. These are represented by 100 N's in the assembly whether or not there is bridging information.
  <LI>Clone - gaps between clones in the same map contig.  These are represented by 50,000 N's in the assembly if the gap is bridged or 100,000 Ns if it is not.
  <LI>Contig - gaps between map contigs. These are represented by 200,000 N's in the assembly.
  <LI>Heterochromatin - gaps from centromeres (3,000,000 N's) or other large blocks of heterochromatin (size varies).
</UL>
