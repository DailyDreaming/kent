<P>CpG islands are associated with genes, particularly housekeeping genes, in vertebrates. 
CpG islands are particularly common near transcription start sites, and may be associated 
with promoter regions.  Normally a C followed immediately by a G (a CpG) 
is rare in vertebrate DNA since the C's in such an arrangement tend to be 
methylated.  This methylation helps distinguish the newly synthesized DNA 
strand from the parent strand, which aids in the final stages of DNA 
proofreading after duplication.  However over evolutionary time methylated 
C's tend to turn into T's because of spontaneous deamination.  The result 
is that CpG's are 
relatively rare unless there is selective pressure to keep them or a 
region is not methylated for some reason, perhaps having to do with 
the regulation of gene expression.  CpG islands 
are regions where CpG's are present at significantly higher levels than 
is typical for the genome as a whole. 
The CpG islands displayed in this browser are all also at least 200 
bases long, and have a GC content of at least 50%.</P>
