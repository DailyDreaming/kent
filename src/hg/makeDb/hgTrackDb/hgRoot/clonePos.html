In dense mode this track shows the coverage level of 
the genome.  Finished regions are shown in black and
draft regions in various shades of gray corresponding
to the coverage.  In full mode this track shows the
position of each contig inside of each draft or finished
clone (each 'fragment') in the assembly.  For some assemblies
clones in the sequencing center tiling path are shown with
blue rather than gray backgrounds.
