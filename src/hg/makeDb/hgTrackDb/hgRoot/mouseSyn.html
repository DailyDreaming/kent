<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows syntenous (corresponding) regions between human and mouse
chromosomes. </P>
<H2>Method</H2>
<P>This track was created by looking for homology to known mouse genes in the draft 
assembly. The mouse data is provided at the chromosome level (not cytoband). </P> 
<H2>Credits</H2>   
<P>The data for this track was kindly provided by Deanna Church at NCBI. Refer to the 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Homology/">NCBI Homology site</A> for more
details.</P>

<H2>Data Release Policy</H2>
<P>Mouse data is made available before scientific publication with the 
following understanding:
<OL>
<LI>The data may be freely downloaded, used in analyses, and 
repackaged in databases.
<LI>Users are free to use the data in scientific papers analyzing 
particular genes and regions, provided that the providers of this data 
(the Mouse Sequencing Consortium) are properly acknowledged.
<LI>The Centers producing the data reserve the right to publish the initial 
large-scale analyses of the dataset-including large-scale identification 
of regions of evolutionary conservation and large-scale 
genomic assembly. Large-scale refers to regions with size on the order of 
a chromosome (that is, 30 Mb or more). 
<LI>Any redistribution of the data should carry this notice.</OL>
