<p>Transcriptome data for chromosomes 21 and 22 from <a
href="http://www.affymetrix.com">Affymetrix</a> as described in "<a
href="http://www.netaffx.com/transcriptome/sci_21_22_paper/index.html">
"Large-Scale Transcriptional Activity in Chromosomes 21 and 22",
Kapranov, P., Cawley, S. E., Drenkow, J., Bekiranov, S, Strausberg,
R. L., Fodor, S.P.A. and Gingeras, T.R.</a>. In general data presented
is the perfect match - mis-match value. Different experiments were
normalized by setting the average value to be the same for each
chip. Replicates for different cell types were averaged together to
produce the data seen in "full" mode for each cell type. In dense
mode, or at the top in full mode, can be seen the maximum value over
all experiments for that probe called "Transcriptome". The idea being
to paint as many transcribed regions as possible.
