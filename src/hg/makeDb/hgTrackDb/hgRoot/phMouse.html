<P>PATTERNHUNTER is a highly sensitive and efficient program for
finding homologies within one, or between two DNA sequences.
On very long sequences it runs faster than MegaBlast while
being more sensitive than Blastn (at its default settings).</P>
<P>This track was produced by having PATTERNHUNTER index human chromosome 22
(taking less than 200Mb) and processing all mouse reads in turn, looking
for double hits of weight 12 (using size 19 words with 7 don't cares in the
pattern 1110100110010101111) to extend from and form gapped alignments.</P>
