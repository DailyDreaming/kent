<h4>Track Description:</h4>
Haplotype blocks derived from common SNPs on Chromosome 21 by <a
href="http://www.perlegen.com">Perlegen</a> as described in "Common
High-Resolution Haplotypes."  Patil, N. et. al. <i>Science</i> 293 (2001)<a
href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/294/5547/1719"> [Science]</a>.
The location of each haplotype block is represented by a blue
horizontal line with tall vertical blue bars at the first and last
SNPs of the block. Individual SNPs are denoted by
smaller black vertical bars. At multi-megabase resolution in dense
mode clusters of tall blue bars may indicate hotspots for
recombination. More information is available for the individual block
selected at the "Outside Link" above and general information on the blocks at Perlegen's main haplotype map page <a
