<h4>Track Description:</h4>

Haplotype blocks derived from common SNPs on Chromosome 21 by
<a href="http://www.perlegen.com">Perlegen Sciences</a> as described
in "Common High-Resolution Haplotypes."  Patil,
N. et. al. <i>Science</i> 294:1719-1723 (2001) <a
href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/294/5547/1719">
[Science]</a>.  The location of each haplotype block is represented by
a blue horizontal line with tall vertical blue bars at the first and
last SNPs of the block. Blocks are displayed as starting at the first
SNP and ending at the last SNP of the block, this is slightly
different from the Perlegen web site where blocks are stretched until
they abut each other.  The shade of the blue indicates the minimum
number of SNP's required to discriminate between haplotype patterns
that account for at least 80% of genotyped chromosomes, darker colors
indicate fewer SNPs are necessary.  Individual SNPs are denoted by
smaller black vertical bars. At multi-megabase resolution in dense
mode clusters of tall blue bars may indicate hotspots for
recombination. More information is available for the individual block
selected at the "Outside Link" above and general information on the
blocks is available at Perlegen's main haplotype map page
