<H2>Description</H2>
The $Organism mRNA track shows alignments between $organism mRNAs
in Genbank and the genome. Aligning regions (exons usually)
are shown as black boxes connected by lines for gap (spliced
out introns usually). In full display, arrows on the introns
indicate the direction of transcription.
<H2>Method</H2>
Genbank $organism mRNAs are aligned against the genome using the 
BLAT program. When a single mRNA aligns in multiple places 
the alignment having the highest base identity is found. 
Only alignments that have a base identity level within 1% of
the best are kept. Alignments must also have at least 95%
base identity to be kept.
<H2>Credits</H2>
The $Organism mRNA track is produced at UCSC from mRNA sequence data
submitted to the international public sequence databases by 
scientists worldwide.
