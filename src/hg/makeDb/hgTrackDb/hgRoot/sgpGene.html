This track shows gene predictions from the sgp program , which is being developed at the Grup de Recerca en Informatica Biomedica at IMIM in Barcelona. To predict genes in a genomic query, sgp combines geneid predictions with tblastx comparisons of the genomic query against other genomic sequences.
