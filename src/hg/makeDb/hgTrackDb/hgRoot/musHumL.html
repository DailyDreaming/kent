<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
   This track displays the conservation between the mouse and human genomes for 
   50bp windows in the mouse genome that have at least 15 bp aligned to
   human. The score for a window reflects the probability that the
   level of observed conservation in that 50bp region would occur by
   chance under neutral evolution. It is given on a logarithmic scale,
   and thus it is called the "L-score". An L-score of 1 means there is a
   1/10 probability that the observed conservation level would occur by
   chance, an L-score of 2 means a 1/100 probability, an L-score of 3
   means a 1/1000 probability, etc. The L-scores display as
   "mountain ranges". Clicking on a mountain range, a detail page is
   displayed from which you can access the base level alignments, both
   for the whole region and for the individual 50bp windows.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<p>
   Genome-wide alignments between mouse and human were produced by
   Blastz. A set of 50bp windows in the mouse genome were determined
   by scanning the sequence, sliding 5 bases at a time, and only those
   windows with at least 15 aligned bases were kept. For each window,
   a conservation score defined by
<br><br>
<center>
   S = sqrt(n/m(1-m))(p-m)
</center>
<br>
   was calculated, where n is the number of aligning bases in the
   window, p is the percent identity between mouse and human for these
   aligning bases, and m is the average percent identity for aligned
   neutrally evolving bases in a larger region surrounding the 50bp
   window being scored. Neutral bases were taken from ancestral repeat
   sequences, which are relics of transposons that were inserted before
   the human-mouse split. To transform S into an L-score, the empirical
   cumulative distribution function CDF(S) = P(x < S)
   is computed from the scores of all windows genome-wide, and
   the L-score is defined as
<br><br>
<center>
   L = -log_10(1 - CDF(S)).
<br>
<br>
The L-score
provides a frequentist confidence assessment. A Bayesian
calculation of the probability that a window is under
selection can also be made using a mixture decomposition of
the empirical density of the scores for all windows
genome-wide into a neutral and a selected component. Details
are given in a manuscript in preparation. The results are
summarized in the table below.

   Thanks to Webb Miller and Scott Schwartz for creating the Blastz
   alignments, Jim Kent for post-processing them, and 
   Mark Diekhans for scoring the windows and selecting out the ancestral repeats. 
   Krishna Roskin created S-scores for these windows. Ryan Weber computed the CDF 
for these S-scores, 
   and created the remaining track display functions.
