<H2>Description</H2> <P> The recombination rate track represents
calculated sex-averaged rates of recombination based on either the
deCODE, Marshfield, or Genethon genetic maps.  By default, the deCODE
map rates are displayed.  Female and Male specific recombination
rates, and well as rates from the Marshfield and Genethon maps, can
also be displayed by choosing the appropriate option on the track user
interface page.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P> The deCODE genetic map was created at 
<a href="http://www.decodegenetics.com/">deCODE Genetics</a> and is 
based on 5,136 microsatellite markers for 146 families with a total
of 1,257 meiotic events.  For more information on this map, please see
"<a href="http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/ng/journal/v31/n3/full/ng917.html">A high resolution recombination map of the human genome</a>", 
<I>Nature Genetics</I>, 31(3), pages 241-247 (2002).
</P>
<P> The Marshfield genetic map was created at the <a
href="http://research.marshfieldclinic.org/genetics/Map_Markers/maps/IndexMapFrames.html">Center
for Medical Genetics</a> and is based on 8,325 short tandem repeat
polymorphisms (STRPS) for 8 CEPH families consisting of 134
individuals with 186 meioses.  For more information on this map,
please see KW Broman, JC Murray, VC Sheffield, RL White and JL Weber,

63:861-689 (1998).
</P>
<P> The Genethon genetic map was created at <a
href="http://www.genethon.fr/php/index_us.php">Genethon</a> and is
based on 5,264 microsatellites for 8 CEPH families consisting of 134
individuals with 186 meioses.  For more information on this map,
please see Dib, et al, "A comprehensive genetic map of the human genome
based on 5,264 microsatellites", <I>Nature</I>, 380, pages 152-154
(1996).

<P> Each base is assigned the recombination rate calculated by
assuming a linear genetic distance across the immediately flanking
genetic markers. The recombination rate assigned to each 1Mb windows
is the average recombination rate of the bases contained within the
window.

This track is produced at UCSC and uses data that is freely available for
the Genethon, Marshfield, and deCODE genetic maps (see above links).  Thanks
to all who have played a part in the creation of these maps.
