<H2>Description</H2>
<P> The recombination rate track represents calculated
sex-averaged  rates of recombination based on the deCODE genetic
map.  Female and Male specific recombination rates can also be
displayed by choosing the appropriate option on the track user
interface page.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P> The deCODE genetic map was created at 
<a href="http://www.decodegenetics.com/">deCODE Genetics</a> and is 
based on 5,136 microsatellite markers for 146 families with a total
of 1,257 meiotic events.  For more information on this map, please see
"<a href="http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/ng/journal/v31/n3/full/ng917.html">A high resolution recombination map of the human genome</a>", 
<I>Nature Genetics</I>, 31(3), pages 241-247.
</P>

<P> Each base is assigned the recombination rate calculated by assuming a
linear genetic distance across the immediately flanking genetic
markers. The recombination rate assigned to each 1Mb windows is the
average recombination rate of the bases contained within the window.
