<H2>Description</H2>
<P> The recombination rate track represents calculated
sex-averaged rates of recombination based on the deCODE genetic
map.  
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P> The deCODE genetic map was created at 
<a href="http://www.decodegenetics.com/">deCODE Genetics</a> and is 
based on 5,136 microsatellite markers for 146 families with a total
of 1,257 meiotic events.  For more information on this map, please see
"<a href="http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/ng/journal/v31/n3/full/ng917.html">A high resolution recombination map of the human genome</a>", 
<I>Nature Genetics</I>, 31(3), pages 241-247.
</P>

<P> Recombination rates are calculated by first binning the genome
into 1Mb, non-overlapping segments.  The recombination rate of each
segment is estimated using the genetic distances from the deCODE map
assuming a constant crossover rate bewteen two adjacent markers.
Cubic splines are fitted to this data using the centerpoint for each
segment and the initial estimated recombination rate for the 1Mb bin.
The resulting value at the midpoint is assigned to each 1Mb region.
