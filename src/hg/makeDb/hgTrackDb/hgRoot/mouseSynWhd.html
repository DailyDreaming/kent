<H2>Data Release Policy</H2>
<P>Mouse data is made available before scientific publication with the 
following understanding:
<OL>
<LI>The data may be freely downloaded, used in analyses, and 
repackaged in databases.
<LI>Users are free to use the data in scientific papers analyzing 
particular genes and regions, provided that the providers of this data 
(the Mouse Sequencing Consortium) are properly acknowledged.
<LI>The Centers producing the data reserve the right to publish the initial 
large-scale analyses of the dataset-including large-scale identification 
of regions of evolutionary conservation and large-scale 
genomic assembly. Large-scale refers to regions with size on the order of 
a chromosome (that is, 30 Mb or more). 
<LI>Any redistribution of the data should carry this notice.</OL>
