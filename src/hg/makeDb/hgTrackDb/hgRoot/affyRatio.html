<h2>GNF Gene Expression Atlas Experiments using Affymetrix GeneChips</h2>

<p>A series of experiments using different normal tissues using <a
href="http://www.affymetrix.com">Affymetrix</a> GeneChips performed by
<a href="http://www.gnf.org">GNF (The Genomics Institute of the
Novartis Research Foundation) </a>. Alignments displayed on the track
correspond the the target sequences used by Affymetrix from which to
choose probes. In dense mode color denotes average signal over
all experiments on a log base 2 scale with lighter colors corresponding
to lower signal and darker colors corresponding to higher signal. In
full mode colors represent the log base 2 ratio of the signal in that
experiment to the median signal of all experiments for that probe.  Please note that
this track is under construction and will not be official until the
GNF publishes their results.

<p>Track options include the ability to group results by chip type,
tissue average, and individual chip identification numbers.
