<H2>Display</H2>
<P>This track displays repeats from <i>phusion.3 mouse</i> aligned to 
the <i>human</i> sequence. Each block is displayed as a vertical bar
on the track with a line connecting all the blocks in an alignment.
The color of each alignment indicates the percent identity of aligned
residues over all blocks of the alignment. 50% identity and below
is lightly colored and the color gets linearly darker as the percent identity
approaches 100%.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The sequences were aligned with blastz (discontiguous exact seeds,
   ungapped extension, local alignments via dynamic programming) and
   postprocessed for single coverage.
