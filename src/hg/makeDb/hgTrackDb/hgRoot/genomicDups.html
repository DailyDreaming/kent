This region was detected as a duplication within the golden path.  
Cut off values &ge; 1 kb of total sequence aligned (containing &ge;500 bp non-RepeatMasked sequence) and &ge; 90%&nbsp;sequence identity. For a description of the 'fuguization' detection method see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11381028&amp;dopt=Abstract">Bailey, <i>et al</i> (2001) Genome Res 11:1005-17</a>. The data was provided by <a href="mailto:eee@cwru.edu">Evan Eichler</a> and <a href="mailto:jab@cwru.edu">Jeff Bailey</a>.  Beware of duplications of greater than 98.5% sequence identity.  Many of these are simply assembly errors in the draft sequence.
