<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track displays the conservation between the human and mouse
genomes for fixed windows of 50 bases, according to Blastz alignments. 
The values shown are L-scores where higher values mean better alignments.</p>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<p>
First a Blastz pairwise alignment was created with human as the
target and mouse as the query sequence. Then we scored each
overlapping 50 base window by sliding 5 bases at a time. The scores
computed here (s-scores) are given by...

These window scores were filtered to only include those with more than 25 aligned
bases. A set of non-overlapping windows with all of their bases in ancient repeats are
held out as evolutionarily neutral and their scores make the neutral
density used to compute the cumulative distribution function CDF so that
CDF(s) = P(x < s) for a uniform random variable x. Thus the L-score for s
is -log10( 1 - CDF(s)) and the L-scores are displayed on the track
itself for all the windows.

Thanks to Mark Diekhans for scoring the windows and selecting out the
ancient repeats. Krishna Roskin then created s-scores for these
windows including the local background calculation. Ryan Weber
computed the CDF for these s-scores, divided up the data by Blastz
best mouse alignment, and created the 'sample' track with the 
detailed alignment display.
