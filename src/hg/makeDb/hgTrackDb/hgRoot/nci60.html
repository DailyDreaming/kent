<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Expression data from "<a href="http://genome-www.stanford.edu/nci60/">
Systematic variation in gene expression patterns in human cancer cell
lines</a>"<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=10700174&amp;dopt=Abstract">[pubmed]</a>,
Ross et al. Nat Genet 2000 Mar;24(3):227-35. cDNA microarrays were
used to explore the variation in expression of approximately 8,000
unique genes among the 60 cell lines used in the National Cancer
Institute's screen for anti-cancer drugs. The authors have provided a
<a href="http://genome-www.stanford.edu/nci60/">web supplement </a>
where more data and experimental description can be obtained. cDNA
probes were placed on the draft human genome using genebank sequences
referenced by the <a href="http://image.llnl.gov/">IMAGE</a> clone ids. 

<h3>Display Options</h3>
This track has options to customize tissue types presented and
the color of the display.

<br><b>Cell Line: </b> This option is only valid when the track is 
displayed in full. It determines how the experiments are displayed. The
options are:
<ul>
<li><b>Tissue Averages: </b> Displays the average of the log ratio scores of all cell lines 
from the different tissue types.</li>
<li><b>All Cell Lines: </b> Displays the log ratio score for all cell line experiments.
</li>
<li><b>Specific Tissues: </b> Displays the log ratio score for all cell lines belonging
to a given tissue type.</li>
<li><b>Duplicates and Unknown: </b> Same as for a Specific Tissue except these experiments 
were duplicates of others or the tissue type was not specified.</li>
</ul>
<b>Color Scheme: </b> 
Data are presented using two color false display. By default
the Brown/Botstein colors of red -> positive log ratio, green -> negative log ratio are used.
However, blue can be substituted for green for those who are color blind.

<h3>Details Page</h3> 
On the details page the probes presented
correspond to those contained in window range seen on the Genome
Browser, the exon probe and experiment selected are highlighted in
blue.
