<P>The chromosome band track represents the approximate 
location of bands seen on Geimsa-stained chromosomes at
an 800 band resolution. </P>
<P>Barbara Trask, Vivian Chung and colleagues used fluorescent in-situ
hybridization (FISH) to locate large genomic clones on the chromosomes.
Arek Kasprzyk and Wonhee Jang determined the location
of these clones on the assembled draft human genome
using the clone sequence where possible and in other cases by
fingerprint analysis and other data.  Terry Furey and
David Haussler developed a program which uses a hidden Markov model
(HMM) to integrate the range of bands associated with various
FISHed clones into the most probable arrangement of bands on the
sequence given the assumptions of the model.<P>
