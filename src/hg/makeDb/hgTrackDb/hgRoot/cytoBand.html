<P>The chromosome band track represents the approximate 
location of bands seen on Giemsa-stained chromosomes at
an 800 band resolution. </P>

<P>Barbara Trask, Vivian Chung, Norma Nowak and the rest of the BAC Resource
Consortium used fluorescent in-situ
hybridization (FISH) to determine a cytogenetic location for 
large genomic clones on the chromosomes.
For more information about the BAC Resource Consortium, please see
"Integration of cytogenetic landmarks into the draft sequence of the human genome",
<A HREF="http://www.nature.com/genomics/human/papers/maps.html"><I>Nature</I>, 
vol 409, Feb. 2001, pp.953-958</A> and the accompanying web site
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/cyto/hbrc.shtml">Human BAC Resource</A>.

<P>Wonhee Jang and Arek Kasprzyk helped determined the location
of these clones on the October assembled draft human genome
using the clone sequence where possible and in other cases by
STS marker and BAC end sequence locations.  
Clone placements are now being determined at UCSC using the same information.</P>

<P>Terry Furey and
David Haussler developed a program which uses a hidden Markov model
(HMM) to integrate the range of bands associated with various
FISHed clones into the most probable arrangement of bands on the
sequence given the assumptions of the model.<P>
