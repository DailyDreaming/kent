<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track displays the level of conservation for each of 11 zoo
species, based on blastz pairwise alignments.</p>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Blastz pairwise alignments were performed between the
NISC-generated sequence for each species and the UCSC compiled
human reference sequence. All sequences were RepeatMasked, where
repetitive sequences were replaced with N's. This prevented alignments from
extending into repetitive regions. </p>
<p>
The strong-hits piptool was used to identify regions of conservation
greater than 50 bp in length. However, for chicken, fugu, and
zebrafish, the stringency was lowered to 25 bp. 
Gray horizontal bars denote a mapping/sequencing gap and percent
identity less than 60% is not shown since it falls below the minimum
y-axis value.</p>

<P>Many thanks to <a href="mailto:elliott@nhgri.nih.gov">Elliott Margulies</a>
for running the blastz alignments, putting the data in the proper
format, and helpful discussions.
