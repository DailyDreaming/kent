<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track displays the level of conservation for each of 12 zoo
species, based on blastz pairwise alignments.</p>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<p>
Blastz pairwise alignments were performed between the NISC-generated
sequence for each species and the UCSC compiled human reference
sequence.
All sequences were RepeatMasked, where repetitive sequences were
denoted
by lower-case letters. The blastz program will not initiate alignments
within repetative regions, but it will extend alignments into
repetitive
regions.</p>
<p>
Gray horizontal bars denote a mapping/sequencing gap and percent
identity
less than 50% is not shown since it falls below the minimum y-axis
value.

<P>Many thanks to <a href="mailto:elliott@nhgri.nih.gov">Elliott Margulies</a>
for running the blastz alignments, putting the data in the proper
format, and helpful discussions.
