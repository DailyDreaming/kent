<P>This track contains the Sanger Centre annotations of
chromosome 22.  The raw data for this track was provided
by Ian Dunham on a slightly different revision of the
chromosome 22 sequence.  Victoria Haghighi remapped this
to the version of the chromosome 22 sequence used here,
and converted the data to a standard GTF format.</P>
