<H2>Description</H2>
The map contigs track shows the locations of contigs of clones
on the physical map.  

<H2>Method</H2>
In assembly versions before the August 6 2001
freeze this track was based on the Washington University accession
map, which in turn was based on a fingerprint contig (FPC) map
described in  <A
HREF="http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/nature/journal/v409/n6822/full/409934a0_fs.html">'A
physical map of the human genome'</A>
in <I>Nature</I> volume 409 pages 934-941.  Starting with the August
6 2001 freeze this track is based on tiling path (TPF) maps curated
by the sequencing centers responsible for each chromosome. Imre
Vastrik at the European Bioinformatics Institute merges the TPF
maps with the FPC map, favoring the TPF map where there are conflicts.
This step increases the clone coverage substantially over that in
the TPF maps.  This merged map is then used as the basis for the
UCSC assemblies.  The clone contigs in this merged map are shown in
this track.
