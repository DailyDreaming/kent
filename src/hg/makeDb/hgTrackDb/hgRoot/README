This directory contains the track database for
the UCSC human genome browser.  The program
hgTrackDb converts the information here into
a 'trackDb' table in the hgN MySQL database.

The bulk of the information about a track is
contained in the trackDb.ra file.  Tracks are
separated from each other in this file by 
a blank line.  Each line begins with an
attribute name and is followed by attribute
value.

The html text about a track is in separate
files named xxx.html where xxx is a
track name.   

There may be subdirectories for each database,
such as 'hg7'.  There is a trackDb.ra file
and xxx.html files in these subdirectories.
Tracks descriptions in the subdirectory will
over-ride track descriptions in this directory.
This allows you to customize a track for
each version of the database.

After editing a track definition here
don't forget to run hgTrackDb to bring
it into the MySQL database.
