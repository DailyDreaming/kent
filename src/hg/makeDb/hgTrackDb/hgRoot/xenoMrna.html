<H2> Description</H2>
This track displays translated blat alignments of
non-$organism vertebrate mRNA from Genbank.  

<H2>Method</H2>
The alignments were passed through a near-best-in-genome filter.

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>The track filter can be used to color, include, or exclude a subset of individual 
items within a track. This is helpful when many items are shown in the track
display, especially when only some are relevant to the current task. To use the
filter:
<OL>
<LI>Enter a value in one or more of the text boxes to filter the mRNA display. For
example, to apply the filter to all brain mRNAs, type "brain" in the 
tissue box. For a list of permissible filter values, consult the non-positional table in
the Table Browser that corresponds to the factor on which you wish to filter. For
example, the non-positional table "tissue" contains all of the types of tissues
that can be entered into the tissue text box. Wildcards can also be used in the
filter.
<LI>If filtering on more than one value, choose the desired combination
logic. If "and" is selected, only mRNAs that match all of the filter criteria will
be highlighted. If "or" is selected, mRNAs that match any 1 of the filter criteria
will be highlighted.
<LI>Choose the color or display characteristic that will be used to highlight or
include/exclude the filtered items. If "exclude" is chosen, the browser will not 
display mRNAs that match the filter criteria. If "include" is selected, the browser 
will display only those mRNAs that match the filter criteria.
<LI>Click the Submit button.
</OL></P>
