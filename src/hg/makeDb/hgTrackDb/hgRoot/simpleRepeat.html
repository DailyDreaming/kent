<h2> Description </h2>
This track displays simple tandem repeats (possibly imperfect) located
by <A HREF="http://tandem.biomath.mssm.edu/trf/trf.html">Tandem Repeats
Finder</A>, which is specialized to this purpose. These repeats can
occur within coding regions of genes and may be quite
polymorphic. Repeat expansions are sometimes associated with specific
diseases.

<h2> Methods </h2>
