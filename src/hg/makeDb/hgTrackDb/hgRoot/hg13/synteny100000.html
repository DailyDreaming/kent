<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows syntenous (corresponding) regions between human and mouse chromosomes. 
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Pass a 100k non-overlapping window over the genome and using the blastz best in mouse genome alignments, look for high scoring regions with at least 40% of the bases aligning with the same region in mouse. Join 100k segments together if they agree in direction and
are within 500kb of each other in human and 4mb in mouse. Gaps are joinedbetween syntenic anchors if the bases between two
flanking regions agree with synteny (direction and mouse location). Finally we extend the syntenic block to include those areas.<p>
