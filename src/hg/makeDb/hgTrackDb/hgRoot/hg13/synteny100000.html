This track shows syntenous (corresponding) regions between human 
and mouse chromosomes.  This track was created by looking for 
homology to known mouse genes in the draft assembly. The method 
used was to align Fgenesh++ predictions using BLAT (protein alignment) 
comparing the Dec 2001 Human assembly with the Nov 2001 Mouse draft assembly.
