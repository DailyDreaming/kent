<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows the draft assembly of the $organism genome.
This assembly merges contigs from overlapping draft and
finished clones into longer sequence contigs.  The sequence
contigs are ordered and oriented when possible by mRNA, EST,
paired plasmid reads (from the SNP Consortium) and BAC end
sequence pairs.</P>
<P>In dense mode, this track depicts in alternating gold and
brown the path through the draft and finished clones (aka the
golden path) used to create the assembled sequence. Where gaps
exist in the path, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  If the relative order and orientation of the contigs
between the two blocks is known, a line is drawn to bridge the
blocks.</P>
