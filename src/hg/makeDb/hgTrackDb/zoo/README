This directory contains the track database for
the UCSC human genome browser.  The program
hgTrackDb converts the information here into
a 'trackDb' table in the hgN MySQL database.

The bulk of the information about a track is
contained in the trackDb.ra file.  Tracks are
separated from each other in this file by 
a blank line.  Each line begins with an
attribute name and is followed by attribute
value.

The html text about a track is in separate
files named xxx.html where xxx is a
track name.   

There may be subdirectories for each database,
such as 'hg7'.  There is a trackDb.ra file
and xxx.html files in these subdirectories.
Tracks descriptions in the subdirectory will
over-ride track descriptions in this directory.
This allows you to customize a track for
each version of the database.

After editing a track definition here
don't forget to run hgTrackDb to bring
it into the MySQL database.  The easiest
way to do this is from this directory:
    cd ..
    make update

Most of the fields in the track.ra file should 
be reasonably self explanitory.  A notable exception
is the type field.  Currently there are three types:
bed, psl, and genePred.  Here is the format of these
type fields:
For bed types it's always three words as follows:
   1) bed (always)
   2) fieldCount - the number of standard fields
   3) extraInfo - either '.' meaning no non-standard fields
       or '+' if there are additional non-standard fields.
For psl types it's
   1) psl
   2) subtype, which is either
        .  (just regular human mRNA)
        est    (human displays a little differently in dense mode)
        xeno (cross species)
There's gene predictions
    1) genePred
    2) (optional) associated protein sequence table
    3) (optional) associated mRNA table.
If something lacks a type field it needs to have custom
display routines.   You can remove a track from the
browser by removing it from the .ra file and doing
a make update.

The shortLabel and longLabel fields may have the following
variables, which will be substituted:
     $ORGANISM
