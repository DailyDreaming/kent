<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the draft assembly of the $organism genome.  

The assembly is 9.5X WGS coverage. The 10,292 supercontigs are displayed
in the UCSC Genome browser as a single artifical chromosome chrUn with an
artifical gap of 1,000 N's between supercontigs. The largest supercontig
is 1,129,006, with 478 supercontigs larger than 93,185 bp (N50) containing
over %50 of the sequence.

<P>
In dense mode, this track depicts the supercontigs.  Supercontig boundaries
are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Arbitrary 1000 base gaps exist between the supercontigs, shown as
spaces between the gold and brown blocks.

<P>
All components within this track are of fragment type &quot;W&quot;: 
Whole Genome Shotgun contig. </P>
