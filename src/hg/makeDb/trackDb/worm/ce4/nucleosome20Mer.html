<P>
20-mer mask: sense strand track shows starts of 20-mers on the sense
strand of the reference genome which are not unique and therefore cannot
be used to unambiguously place individual reads. These are the positions
where no 'sense' nucleosomal fragment starts can be unambiguously placed
from 20 nt reads.

<P>
20-mer mask: antisense strand track shows starts of 20-mers on the
antisense strand of the reference genome which are not unique and
therefore cannot be used to unambiguously place individual reads.
These are the positions where no 'antisense' nucleosomal fragment
starts can be unambiguously placed from 20 nt reads.
