nuclesomes: sense reads 
Description
nuclesomes: sense reads track shows the spans of 147 bp nucleosomal
fragments based on the positions of SOLiD cores aligned to the sense
strand of the reference C. elegans genome. The thick portion of the
green band represents the actual 20 bp of reads that were aligned.

nuclesomes: antisense reads
Description
nuclesomes: antisense reads track shows the spans of 147 bp nucleosomal
fragments based on the position of SOLiD cores aligned to the antisense
strand of the reference C. elegans genome. The thick portion of the blue
band represents the actual 20 bp of reads that were aligned.

20-mer mask: sense strand
Description
20-mer mask: sense strand track shows starts of 20-mers on the sense
strand of the reference genome which are not unique and therefore cannot
be used to unambiguously place individual reads. These are the positions
where no 'sense' nucleosomal fragment starts can be unambiguously placed
from 20 nt reads.

20-mer mask: antisense strand
Description
20-mer mask: antisense strand track shows starts of 20-mers on the
antisense strand of the reference genome which are not unique and
therefore cannot be used to unambiguously place individual reads.
These are the positions where no 'antisense' nucleosomal fragment
starts can be unambiguously placed from 20 nt reads.

genomic DNA: sense reads
Description
genomic DNA: sense reads track shows random 20 nt sequence reads from
sheared C. elegans genomic DNA that align with the sense strand of the
reference genome.  For comparison to the nucleosomal reads, these are
displayed in the same way as nucleosomal fragments. This track provides
a measure of "sequenceability" across the genome.

of the reference genome.  For comparison to the nucleosomal reads, these
