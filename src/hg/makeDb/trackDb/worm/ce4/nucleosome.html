<H3>Mononucleosome control track</H3>
The control data was produced from the lightly Micrococcal 
nuclease-digested paired-end sequenced genomic DNA fragments in the 
size range of 400-900 bps. Each feature corresponds to one end of the 
paired-end fragment with thick portion representing the sequenced 25 
bps of that end. Features span 147 bps (displayed equivalently to 
mononucleosome data). Mapped reads were collapsed and color-coded 
from the lightest to the darkest in five shades according to the 
following category-based scale: 1 read instance, 2 inctances, 3-5 
instances, 6-10 instances, more than 10 instances. Upon mousing over 
a feature, the number of read instances starting at that bp can be 
observed.

<H3>Mononucleosome sense strand reads</H3>
Mononucleosomal fragments were obtained by Micrococcal nuclease 
digestion of C. elegans lysates, DNA extraction, and sequencing of 
nucleosome-bound DNA fragments. Features represent inferred 147 bp 
cores from fragments that mapped to the sense strand of the reference 
genome. The thick portion of each feature (50bps) represents the 
sequenced part of the nucleosome-bound fragment. Sequences starting 
at the same bp were collapsed and displayed as shades of blue (from 
lightest to darkest) according to the following category-based 
scale:: 1 read instance, 2 read instances, 3-5 instances, 6-10 
instances, more than 10 instances. Upon mousing over a feature, the 
number of read instances starting at that bp can be observed.

<H3>Mononucleosome antisense strand reads</H3>
Mononucleosomal fragments were obtained by Micrococcal nuclease 
digestion of C. elegans lysates, DNA extraction and sequencing of 
nucleosome-bound DNA fragments. Features represent inferred 147 bp 
cores from fragments that mapped to the antisense strands. The thick 
portion of each feature (50bps) represents the sequenced part of the 
core. Sequences starting at the same bp were collapsed and displayed 
as shades of green (from lightest to darkest) according to the 
following category-based scale: 1 read instance, 2 read instances, 
3-5 instances, 6-10 instances, more than 10 instances.
