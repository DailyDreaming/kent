<P>
Sheared genomic DNA displayed as mononucleosomal fragments, sense strand reads:
shows random 20 nt sequence reads from sheared C. elegans genomic DNA that
align with the sense strand of the reference genome.  For comparison to the
nucleosomal reads, these are displayed in the same way as nucleosomal
fragments. This track provides a measure of "sequenceability" across the
genome.

<P>
Sheared genomic DNA displayed as mononucleosomal fragments, antisense
strand reads: shows random 20 nt sequence reads from sheared C. elegans
genomic DNA that align with the antisense strand of the reference genome.
For comparison to the nucleosomal reads, these are displayed in the same
way as nucleosomal fragments. This track provides a measure of
"sequenceability" across the genome.
