<H2>Description</H2>
<P>Gene predictions on $date release of <em>$organism</em> sequences.
Fgenesh++ predictions are based on Softberry's gene finding software. </P>

<P>
The 19112 genes includes 4682 genes corresponding to known mRNAs, 
13085 having similarity with proteins from NR database, and 
1345 <em>ab initio</em> predictions.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<A HREF="http://www.softberry.com/berry.phtml?topic=fgenesh" 
TARGET=_blank>Fgenesh++</A> uses both hidden Markov models (HMMs) and protein 
similarity to find genes in a completely automated manner. For more information, 
see the paper Solovyev VV (2001), &quot;Statistical approaches in Eukaryotic gene
prediction&quot; in the <em>Handbook of Statistical Genetics</em>
(ed. Balding D. et al.), John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., p. 83-127.
