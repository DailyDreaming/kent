<P>Gene predictions on May 2003 release of C. elegans sequences.
Fgenesh++ predictions are based on Softberry's gene finding software. </P>

<P>
19112 genes includes  4682 genes correponding known mRNA and
 13085 having similarity with proteins from NR database and 
 1345 ab initio predictions.

Fgenesh++ </A> uses both hidden Markov models (HMMs) and protein similarity to
find genes in a completely automated manner. For more information, see the
paper Solovyev VV (2001), &quot;Statistical approaches in Eukaryotic gene
prediction&quot; in the <em>Handbook of Statistical Genetics</em>
(ed. Balding D. et al.), John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., p. 83-127.
