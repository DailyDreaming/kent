<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The RefSeq Genes track shows known protein coding genes taken from mRNA 
reference sequences compiled at LocusLink. Coding exons are represented by 
blocks connected by horizontal lines representing introns. The 5' and 3' 
untranslated regions (UTRs) are displayed as shorter blocks on the leading 
and trailing ends of the aligning regions. In full display mode, arrowheads 
on the connecting intron lines indicate the direction of transcription.

<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
Refseq mRNAs are aligned against the genome using the <A HREF="http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat" TARGET=_blank>blat</A>
program. When a single mRNA aligns in multiple places, only
the best alignments which also have at least 98% sequence identity are kept.
</P>
<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
The RefSeq Genes track is produced at UCSC from mRNA sequence data
generated by scientists worldwide and curated by the 
NCBI <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/RefSeq/" TARGET=_blank>RefSeq project</A>.
