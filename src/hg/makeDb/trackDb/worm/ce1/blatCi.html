<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The Ciona genome shotgun assembly was constructed with the JGI assembler, JAZZ, paired end sequencing reads at a coverage of 8.2X produced at the JGI. The assembly contains 116.7 million base pairs of nonrepetitive sequence in 2,501 scaffolds greater than 3 kb. Half of this (60 Mbp) is assembled into 117 scaffolds longer than 190 Kbp; 85% of the assembly (104.1 Mbp) is found in 905 scaffolds longer than 20 kb. Gene modeling and analysis were performed at the JGI.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The alignments were done 
with BLAT in translated protein mode requiring 2 nearby 4-mer matches
to trigger a detailed alignment.  </P>
