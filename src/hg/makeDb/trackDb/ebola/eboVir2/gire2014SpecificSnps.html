<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
This track displays variants identified by Gire <em>et al.</em> in 81 isolates
from the 2014 strain of Ebola virus (78 from Sierra Leone and 3 from Guinea)
that are specific to the 2014 strain. At least one 2014 isolate carries a base not found 
elsewhere in the EBOV alignment.

<H2>Display Conventions</H2>
<p>
Items are labeled by ancestral nucleotide and 2014-derived nucleotide.
Non-coding variants are black, synonymous variants are green,
and missense variants are red and also labeled by gene and amino acid change.
Click on an item to view more details such as the derived allele frequency
in 2014 isolates and, for missense changes, the
