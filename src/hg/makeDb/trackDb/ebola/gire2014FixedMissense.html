<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
This track displays variants identified by Gire <em>et al.</em> in 81 isolates
from the 2014 strain of Ebola virus (78 from Sierra Leone and 3 from Guinea)
that are specific to the 2014 strain, fixed (i.e. present in all 81 isolates),
and that cause protein-coding changes.

<p>
Items are labeled by gene and amino acid change. The labels of two items also contain "*CONS"
to indicate that the changed position is fully conserved across the Ebola genus.
