<H2>Description</H2>
<P>SSLP stands for <b>S</b>imple <b>S</b>equence <b>L</b>ength 
<b>P</b>olymorphisms, also known as microsatellite DNA. SSLPs are 1-6 
   simple nucleotide repeat sequences, highly polymorphic in length of repeat 
   among strains and are often used as genetic markers for genotyping.</p>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The annotation data file, RGD_SSLP.gff, is downloaded from 
<UL>
<LI>ftp://rgd.mcw.edu/pub/RGD_genome_annotations/V3.1/GFF_files/ 
</UL>
and processed to 
create two UCSC Genome Browser tables, rgdSslp and rgdSslpLink to enable this track.
