<H2>Description</H2>
This track shows the locations of contigs of clones
on the physical map.  

<H2>Method</H2>
In assembly versions prior to the August 2001
freeze, this track was based on the Washington University accession
map, which in turn was based on a fingerprint contig (FPC) map
described in &quot;<A

From the August 2001 to the Nov 2002 freeze, this track was based on
tiling path (TPF) maps curated by the sequencing centers responsible for
each chromosome, which were integrated into an assembly done by NCBI.
Beginning with the April 2003 freeze, the chromosome coordinators
at the individual sequencing centers took over complete responsibility
for preparing the assembly of their choromosomes in AGP format. The
files provided by these centers are checked and validated at NCBI, and
form the basis for the definition of the physical map contigs.
