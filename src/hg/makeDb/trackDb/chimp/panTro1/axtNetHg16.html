<H2>Description</H2>
This track shows best-in-genome chimpanzee/human alignments
based on the chimpanzee/human alignment net;  i.e.,
the best chain for every part of the human genome.  
This track displays alignment scores, and when zoomed in to
the base level, the alignment itself is displayed.
The human sequence used in this annotation is from
the July 2003 (hg16) assembly.</P>
<P>
In the graphical display, the shade (in dense display mode) 
or height (in full mode) of a vertical line indicates the score 
of the best chained and netted alignment at that location.  
Clicking on the track brings up detailed information about the 
alignments in the currently displayed range of positions.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
First, chains are derived from 
<A HREF="http://bio.cse.psu.edu/dist/blastz.pdf" TARGET=_blank>blastz</A> 
and blat alignments as described in the description page of the Human Chain track.
Subsequently, these chains were merged, sorted, and netted
to obtain the best alignments.  These methods are
described in the Human Net track description.

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
The chaining and netting programs were
developed at the University of California
at Santa Cruz by Jim Kent.
