<H3>About the <em>Pan troglodytes</em> assembly</H3>
<P>
The November 2003 chimpanzee draft sequence (UCSC version panTro1) 
was produced by the Chimpanzee Genome Sequencing Consortium. 
The sequence covers about 90 percent of the genome,
and has been sequenced to 4X coverage.
<P>
Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotation data are available via 
the Genome Browser <A HREF="ftp://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/panTro1/">FTP
server</A> or the <A HREF="/downloads#chimp">Downloads</A> page. 
The chimpanzee browser annotation tracks were generated by UCSC and 
collaborators worldwide. See the <A HREF="/goldenPath/credits.html#chimp_credits">Credits</A> 
page for a detailed list of the organizations and individuals who contributed 
to the success of this release. 

<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of a
sequenced genomic clone, an mRNA or EST or STS marker, or
a cytological band, a chromosomal coordinate range, or keywords from 
the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list shows 
examples of valid position queries for the chimpanzee genome.
