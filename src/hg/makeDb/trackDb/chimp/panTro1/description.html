<H3>About the <em>Pan troglodytes</em> assembly</H3>
<P>
The 13 Nov. 2003 chimpanzee Arachne assembly -- labeled Build 1 Version 1 
(UCSC version panTro1) -- was produced by the Chimpanzee Genome Sequencing Consortium.
This assembly covers about 95 percent of the genome and is based on 4X sequence 
coverage. It is composed of 361,782 contigs with an N50 length of 15.7 kb, and 
37,849 supercontigs having an N50 length of 8.6 Mb (not including gaps). The total 
contig length is 2.73 Gb, spanning 3.02 Gb.

For more information about the assembly process used for this draft genome, see the 
Assembly track details page. To view a mapping of chimp chromosomes to human 
chromosomes, click <A HREF="/FAQ/FAQdownloads.html#download25">here</A>.
<P>
The current version of the Chimp Blat server does not support
searches on chrUn_random. This will be added post-release.
Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotation data are available via 
the Genome Browser <A HREF="ftp://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/panTro1/">FTP
server</A> or the <A HREF="/downloads#chimp">Downloads</A> page. 
The chimpanzee browser annotation tracks were generated by UCSC and 
collaborators worldwide. See the <A HREF="/goldenPath/credits.html#chimp_credits">Credits</A> 
page for a detailed list of the organizations and individuals who contributed 
to the success of this release. 

<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of a
sequenced genomic clone, an mRNA or EST or STS marker, or
a cytological band, a chromosomal coordinate range, or keywords from 
the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list shows 
examples of valid position queries for the chimpanzee genome.
