<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track indicates GC counts in a sliding window of 5 bases.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
To accentuate the difference between AT and GC rich regions,
the scale of the graph runs from -2 to +3 for the range
of GC counts from 0 to 5. Thus, GC counts of 3, 4 and 5 are
graphed as positive values 1,2 and 3 in blue.  GC counts
of 0 and 1 are graphed as negative values -2 and -1 in red.
A GC count of 2, which is the mean, appears as a red line at value 0.

<P> Suggested improvement:
	GC count of 2 can not be seen easily at the zero value.

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>The track filter can be used to configure display attributes of
the track's graph. 
<UL>
<LI><B>Type of graph</B>: The default &quot;Bar&quot; setting depicts the graph
data using filled-in bars. To switch to a view in which the data are
represented by points or lines,
select the 
&quot;Points&quot; setting. 
<LI><B>Show y=-0.0 line</B>: Select the &quot;ON&quot; setting to display a
line marking the 0.0 position on the graph (default is &quot;OFF&quot;).
<LI><B>Track height</B>: To change the default display height of the graph
in pixels, type in a different value between 11 and 128
(the default display height is 36 pixels).
<LI><B>Vertical viewing range</B>: By default, the viewing range is set to
the values of min: -2, max: 3.
Type in a different value to reduce the range of data values displayed. 
<LI><B>Data view scaling</B>: The default &quot;Use Vertical Viewing Range
Setting" displays the data using the parameters specified in the Vertical
viewing range setting.  To configure the graph to automatically scale to a
range defined by the minimum and maximum data points in the current 
view, select the &quot;Auto-Scale to data view&quot; option.
