<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is known, it is a <em>bridged</em> gap. In this case, a white 
line is drawn through the black box representing the gap, and the gap label 
contains the word "yes".

<P>There are 5 types of gaps in the Nov. 2003 chimpanzee assembly:
<UL>
<LI><B>Fragment</B> - gaps between the whole genome shotgun (WGS) contigs 
of the Arachne assembly, represented by 100 N's.
In this assembly, all fragment gaps are bridged.
<LI><B>Contig</B> - gaps between the scaffolds ("super-contigs")
constructed from the WGS contigs.  For the pseudo-chromosomes containing 
scaffolds that could not be confidently placed on a chromosome (e.g. chrN_random), 
these gaps are represented by 50,000 N's, with the exception of
chrUn_random, where the gaps are 10,000 N's.  For all other chromosomes,
the gap size is based on the distance between scaffolds when aligned
to the finished human genome assembly, as described in the
Assembly track description.
<LI><B>Heterochromatin, Centromere, Telomere</B> - gaps from large blocks of heterochromatin (size varies).
