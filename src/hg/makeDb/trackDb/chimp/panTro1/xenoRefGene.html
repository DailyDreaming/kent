<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows known human protein-coding genes taken from the NCBI mRNA 
reference sequences collection (RefSeq). </P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track follows the display conventions for 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay">gene prediction 
tracks</A>.
The color shading indicates the level of review the RefSeq record has 
undergone: predicted (light), provisional (medium), reviewed (dark). 
In some assemblies, non-coding RNA genes are shown in a separate track.</P>
<P>
The item labels and display colors of features within this track can be
configured through the controls at the top of the track description page. 
<UL>
<LI><B>Label:</B> By default, items are labeled by gene name. Click the 
appropriate Label option to display the accession name instead of the gene
name, show both the gene and accession names, or turn off the label 
completely.
<LI><B>Codon coloring:</B> This track contains an optional codon coloring 
feature that allows users to quickly validate and compare gene predictions.
To display codon colors, select the <em>genomic codons</em> option from the
<em>Color track by codons</em> pull-down menu. Click 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgCodonColoring.html">here</A> for more 
information about this feature.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The mRNAs were aligned against the $organism genome using blat; those
with an alignment of less than 15% were discarded. When a single mRNA aligned 
in multiple places, the alignment having the highest base identity was 
identified.  Only alignments having a base identity level within 0.5% of 
the best and at least 25% base identity with the genomic sequence were kept.
