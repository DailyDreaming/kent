<P>
This track shows the draft assembly of the 13 Nov. 2003 $organism genome.
<P>
To build the genome, a &quot;modified de novo&quot; (MDN) assembly was created first, using the 
human genome to 
determine -- among other things -- that particular inserts were not chimeric. A separate &quot;validated
chimp-on-human&quot; (VCH) assembly was created by taking the chimp reads that align
uniquely to human, forming them into contigs via this alignment, and then removing
those contigs that failed a two-haplotype consistency check. Shared reads were then
used to align the two assemblies to one another. In positions where the sequence
was consistent, it was transferred from the VCH to the MDN assembly, further 
enriching the latter. Two global misassemblies were manually removed from the
merged assembly. This final assembly comprises the Nov. 2003 draft
release.
<P>
The assembly is composed of 361782 contigs with an N50 length of 15.7 kb. The total
contig length is 2.73 Gb, spanning 3.02 Gb. The assembly contains 37849 supercontigs
having an N50 length of 8.6 Mb (not including gaps).
<P>
In dense mode, this track depicts the path through the draft 
clones (aka the golden path) used to create the assembled sequence. 
Clone boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Where gaps
exist in the path, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  If the relative order and orientation of the contigs
between the two blocks is known, a line is drawn to bridge the
blocks.</P>
