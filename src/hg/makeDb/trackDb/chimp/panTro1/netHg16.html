<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the chimpanzee/human alignment net.
It is useful for finding orthologous regions and for studying genome
rearrangement.  
<P>
In the graphical display, the boxes represent ungapped 
alignments, while the lines represent gaps.  
In full display mode, the top-level (Level 1)
chains are the largest, highest-scoring chains that
span this region.  In many cases, gaps exist in the
top-level chains.  When possible, these are filled in by
other chains displayed at Level 2.  The gaps in 
Level 2 chains may be filled by Level 3 chains and so
forth.
Clicking on a box displays detailed information about the chain
as a whole, while clicking on a line shows information
on the gap.  The detailed information is useful in determining
the cause of the gap or, for lower-level chains, the genomic
rearrangement. 
<P>
Individual track features are categorized as one of four types
(other than gap):
<UL>
<LI><B>Top</B> - the best, longest match. Displayed on Level 1.
<LI><B>Syn</B> - aligns to the same scaffold as the gap in the level
    above it.
<LI><B>Inv</B> - aligns to the same scaffold as the gap above it, but in the
    opposite orientation.
<LI><B>NonSyn</B> - matches a different scaffold from the gap in the level 
above it.
</UL></P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
These alignments were generated using <A HREF="http://bio.cse.psu.edu/dist/blastz.pdf" 
TARGET=_blank>blastz</A> and blat alignments of
genomic sequence from the July 2003 human genome assembly
(UCSC hg16, NCBI Build 34).
The initial alignments were generated using blastz on 
repeatmasked sequence using the following chimp/human scoring matrix:
<PRE>
     A    C    G    T
A   100 -300 -150 -300
C  -300  100 -300 -150
G  -150 -300  100 -300
T  -300 -150 -300  100

K = 4500, L = 3000,  Y=3400, H=2000
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The resulting alignments were processed by the axtChain program.
AxtChain organizes all the alignments between a single chimp scaffold
and a single $organism chromosome into a group and makes a kd-tree out
of all the gapless subsections (blocks) of the alignments.
The maximally-scoring chains of these blocks were found by running a
dynamic program over the kd-tree.  Chains scoring below a certain
threshold were discarded.
<P>
To place additional chimp scaffolds that weren't initially aligned by blastz,
a DNA blat of the unmasked sequence was performed. The resulting
blat alignments were also chained, and then merged with the
blastz-based chains produced in the previous step to produce a
merged set of chains, which are displayed 
in the "Human Chain" track.
<P>
These chains were sorted such that the highest scoring chain in the
genome was first. The program chainNet was then used to place
each chain one at a time, trimming it as necessary to
fit into a section not already covered by 
a higher-scoring chain. During this process, a
natural hierarchy emerges in which chains that fill gaps
in a previous chain are considered underneath the
previous chain. The program netSyntenic was used to fill in
information about the relationship between upper-
and lower-level chains, including whether a lower-level
chain is syntenic with the higher-level chain,  whether
it is inverted with respect to the higher-level chain,
and so forth.
