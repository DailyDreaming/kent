<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows known human protein-coding genes taken from the NCBI mRNA 
reference sequences collection (RefSeq). 
Coding exons are represented by blocks connected by horizontal lines 
representing introns. The 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) are 
displayed as thinner blocks on the leading and trailing ends of the 
aligning regions. In full display mode, arrowheads on the connecting intron 
lines indicate the direction of transcription.</P>

<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
The mRNAs were aligned against the $organism genome using blat; those
with an alignment of less than 15% were discarded. When a single mRNA aligned 
in multiple places, the alignment having the highest base identity was 
identified.  Only alignments having a base identity level within 0.5% of 
the best and at least 25% base identity were kept.</P>

<LI><B>Labels:</B> By default, items are labeled by gene name. Click the 
appropriate Label option to display the accession name instead of the gene
name, show both the gene and accession names, or turn off the label 
completely.
<LI><B>Codon coloring:</B> This track contains an optional codon coloring 
feature that allows users to quickly validate and compare gene predictions.
To display codon colors, select the <em>genomic codons</em> option from the
<em>Color track by codons</em> pull-down menu. Click
