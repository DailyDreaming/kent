<P>
The January 2006 chimpanzee (<em>Pan troglodytes</em>) browser displays
data from the 6X whole genome shotgun (WGS) draft assembly (Build 
2 Version 1, Oct. 2005) produced by the 
<A HREF="http://genome.wustl.edu/genome.cgi?GENOME=Pan%20troglodytes&SECTION=collaborators" TARGET=_BLANK>
Chimpanzee Genome Sequencing Consortium</A>.
This assembly contains sequence from the initial 4X chimpanzee assembly
which is described and analyzed in the Nature (Sept. 2005) article
<A HREF="http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/DIR/Chimp_Analysis.pdf"
TARGET=_BLANK>
Initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome</A>,
with an additional 2X sequence generated, assembled, and assigned to 
chromosomes by the 
<A HREF="http://genome.wustl.edu/genome.cgi?GENOME=Pan%20troglodytes" TARGET=_BLANK>
Genome Sequencing Center of Washington University, St. Louis</A>.
<P>
A major difference between this assembly and the previous is that
the chromosomal numbering has been changed to reflect the
new standard that preserves orthology with human chromomes.
Proposed by McConkey, et.al. in 2004 (Cytogenetics and Genome Research, 105:157-158), 
the new numbering convention was subsequently endorsed by the 
International Chimpanzee Genome Consortium.
This standard assigns the two chromosomes corresponding to human 
chromosome 2 the identifiers "2a" and "2b".
<P>
The chimpanzee is the species most closely related to human, but is
<A HREF="http://ecos.fws.gov/species_profile/servlet/gov.doi.species_profile.servlets.SpeciesProfile?spcode=A06C" TARGET=_BLANK> endangered</A>, 
and is consequently the focus of multiple

<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee gene 
name of a human RefSeq, the accession number of a
mRNA or EST, a chromosomal coordinate range, 
or keywords from 
the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list shows 
examples of valid position queries for the chimpanzee genome.

<H3>Assembly details</H3>
This assembly covers about 97 percent of the genome and is based on 6X
sequence coverage. It is composed of 265,882 contigs with an N50
length of 29 kb, and 44,460 supercontigs with an N50 length of 9.7
Mb. The total contig length, not including estimated gap sizes, is
2.97 Gb.  Of that total, 2.82 Gb of sequence have been ordered and oriented 
along specific chimpanzee chromosomes, 107 Mb have been placed in chr*_random,
and 50 Mb remain in chrUn.
<P>
The whole genome shotgun data from primary donor-derived reads (Clint,
a captive-born male chimpanzee from the Yerkes Primate Research Center
(Atlanta, USA)) and were assembled using PCAP (Huang 2006) using
stringent parameters derived by eliminating detectable global
mis-assemblies (interchromosomal cross-overs determined by alignment
of the chimpanzee genome against the human genome) larger than 50kb.
<P>
The assembly data were aligned against the human genome at UCSC
(B. Raney) utilizing BLASTZ (Schwartz 2003) to align and score
non-repetitive chimpanzee regions against repeat-masked human
sequence. Alignment chains differentiated between orthologous and
paralogous alignments (Kent 2003) and only "reciprocal best"
alignments were retained in the alignment set. The chimpanzee AGP
files were generated from these alignments in a manner similar to that
already described (The Chimpanzee Genome Sequencing Consortium 2005).
Centromeres were introduced into the chimp sequence at the positions
of the centromeres in the human chromosomes.  Ten documented/known
human inversions (Yunis 1982) supported by the assembly were
introduced into the ordering as was the separation of alignments to
human chromosome 2 into chimpanzee chromosomes 2A and 2B.  We replaced
the regions in the WGS assembly corresponding to the finished
chromosome 21 sequence (see Credits), chr Y sequence (see Credits) and
a 5 Mb finished region from chimpanzee chromosome 7 (see Credits) with
the corresponding finished AGPs/sequences.

The chimpanzee browser annotation tracks were generated by UCSC and 
collaborators worldwide. See the <A HREF="../goldenPath/credits.html#chimp_credits">Credits</A>
