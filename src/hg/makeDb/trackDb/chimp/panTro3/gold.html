<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the assembly (Oct. 2010, CGSC 2.1.3 (GCA_000001515.3))
of the $organism genome provided by the
Chimpanzee Genome Sequencing Consortium.<BR>

Please note description of this assembly in the genbank record:
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AACZ00000000"
TARGET=_blank>AACZ00000000.3</A>

</P>
<P>
In dense mode, this track depicts the path through the 
fragments (contigs and finished clones) used to create the
assembled chromosomes.  Contig and clone boundaries are distinguished
by the use of alternating gold and brown coloration. Where gaps exist
in the path, spaces are shown between the gold and brown blocks.
Relative order and orientation, as determined from the human/chimp alignments,
is implied for the non-random chromosomes.
<P>
The fragment types within this track are:
<UL>
<LI><B>F</B> - Finished (46 sequences on chrM, chr21, chr7 and unlocalized chrY)
<LI><B>W</B> - Whole Genome Shotgun contig (45,575 sequences)
<LI><B>O</B> - Other sequence (5 sequences on chrY)
</UL>
