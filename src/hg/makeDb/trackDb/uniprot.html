<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows protein sequence annotations from the <a
href="http://www.UniProt.org/" target="_blank">UniProt/SwissProt</A> database,
mapped to genomic coordinates. It also shows how the protein sequences in this database 
map to the genome.
The data has been curated from scientific publications by the UniProt/SwissProt staff.
The annotations are divided into multiple subtracks, based on their &quot;feature type&quot; in UniProt:

For consistency, the subtrack &quot;UniProt/SwissProt Variants&quot; is a copy of the track
&quot;UniProt Variants&quot; in the track group &quot;Phenotype and Literature&quot;, or 
&quot;Variation and Repeats&quot;, depending on the assembly.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
Genomic locations of UniProt/SwissProt annotations are labeled with a short name for
the type of annotation (e.g. &quot;glyco&quot;, &quot;disul&quot;, &quot;signal pep&quot; etc.).
A click on them shows the full annotation and provides a link to the UniProt/SwissProt
record for more details. TrEMBL annotations are always shown in light-blue. </p>

<p>
Mouse over a feature to see the full UniProt annotation comment. For variants, the mouse over will show the full name of the UniProt disease acronym.
</p>

<p>
In the &quot;UniProt other&quot; track, modified residues are highlighted in light green
glycosylation sites in dark green, disulfide bonds in grey.</p>

<p>
The subtracks for domains related to a subcellular location are sorted from outside to inside of the cell: signal (yellow), extracellular (blue), transmembrane (green), cytoplasmic (orange), nucleus (red).
</p>

<p>
Duplicate annotations are removed as far as possible: if a TrEMBL annotation has the same genome position and same feature type, comment, disease and mutated amino acids as a SwissProt annotation, it is not shown again. Two annotations mapped through different transcripts but with the same genome coordinates are only shown once.
</p>

<p>Note that only for the human hg38 assembly and SwissProt annotations, there also is a 
<a href="hgTracks?db=hg38&hubUrl=ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/genome_annotation_tracks/UP000005640_9606_hub/hub.txt">public track hub</a> prepared by UniProt itself, with 
genome annotations maintained by UniProt using their own mapping
method based on those Gencode/Ensembl gene models that are annotated in UniProt for a given protein.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
UniProt sequences were aligned to UCSC/Gencode transcript sequences first with
BLAT, then lifted to genome positions with pslMap.  UniProt annotations were
obtained from the UniProt XML file.  The annotations were then mapped to the genome
through the alignment using the pslMap program.  This mapping approach
draws heavily on the <A HREF="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/LS-SNP/"
TARGET="_BLANK">LS-SNP</A> pipeline by Mark Diekhans. For human and mouse, the alignments were filtered again
by retaining only proteins known to be linked to a given transcript from the meta data.
The complete script is
part of the kent source tree and is located in src/hg/utils/otto/uniprot. The exact commands

<h2>Data Access</h2>

<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a>, or the
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>.
For automated analysis, the genome annotation is stored in a bigBed file that 
can be downloaded from the
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/uniprot/" target="_blank">download server</a>.
The exact filenames can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/hg/makeDb/trackDb/trackDb.uniprot.ra">track configuration file</a>. 
Annotations can be converted to ASCII text by our tool <tt>bigBedToBed</tt>
which can be compiled from the source code or downloaded as a precompiled
binary for your system. Instructions for downloading source code and binaries can be found
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">here</a>.
The tool can also be used to obtain only features within a given range, for example:
<br> 
<tt>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/uniprot/unipStruct.bb -chrom=chr6 -start=0 -end=1000000 stdout</tt>

Older releases of the data files can be downloaded from the <a href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/$db/archive/">archive folder</a> of our downloads server.
