Haplotype blocks on Chromosome 22 from <a href="http://bioinformatics.well.ox.ac.uk/" TARGET=_blank>The University of Oxford</a> and 
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/" TARGET=_blank>The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>, as described
in Dawson E. et. al. (2002), "<a href="http://bioinformatics.well.ox.ac.uk/~lon/chr22/data/chr22ld.pdf" TARGET=_blank>A first-generation linkage disequilibrium map of human chromosome 22</A>", <em>Nature</em> 418:544-8. 
</P><P>
The location of each haplotype block is represented by
a blue horizontal line with tall vertical blue bars at the first and
last SNPs of the block. Blocks are displayed as starting at the first
SNP and ending at the last SNP of the block.  Individual SNPs are denoted by
smaller black vertical bars. At multi-megabase resolution in dense
display mode, clusters of tall blue bars may indicate hotspots for
recombination.
