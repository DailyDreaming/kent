The $organism 

<A HREF="http://mgc.nci.nih.gov/">Mammalian Gene Collection</A> EST
in-progress track shows genomic alignments of $organism MGC ESTs that are in
the full-length sequencing pipeline.  This includes current picks, ESTs
submitted for sequences, and ones pending full-length conformation.

<H2>Credits</H2>
The $Organism MGC EST tracks are produced at UCSC from EST sequence data
submitted to 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html">Genbank</A>
by the 
<A HREF="http://mgc.nci.nih.gov/">Mammalian Gene Collection</A> project.
