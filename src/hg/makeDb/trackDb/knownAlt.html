<H2>Description</H2>
This track shows various types of alternative splicing and other
events that result in more than a single transcript from the same
gene.  The label by an item describes the type of event.  These are:
<UL>
<LI><B>altPromoter</B> - Transcription starts at multiple places.
<LI><B>altFinish</B> - Transcription ends at multiple places.
<LI><B>cassetteExon</B> - Exon is present in some transcripts but not others. 
These are found by looking for exons that overlap an intron in the same transcript.
<LI><B>retainedIntron</B> - Introns that are spliced out in some transcripts but not others. 
In some cases, particularly when the intron is near the 3' end, this can reflect an 
incompletely processed transcript rather than a true alt-splicing event.
<LI><B>bleedingExon</B> - Initial or terminal exons that overlap in intron in another
transcript. These often are associated with incompletely processed transcripts.
<LI><B>altThreePrime</B> - Variations on the  3' end of an intron.
<LI><B>altFivePrime</B> - Variations on the 5' end of an intron.
<LI><B>atacIntron</B> - An intron with AT/AC ends rather than the usual GT/AG. These
are associated with the minor spliceosome.
<LI><B>strangeSplice</B> - An intron with ends that are not GT/AG, GC/AG, or AT/AC.  These
are usually artifacts of some sort due to sequencing error or polymorphism.
<H2>Credits</H2>
This track is based on an analysis by the <TT>txgAnalyse</TT> program of splicing graphs
produced by the <TT>txGraph</TT> program.  Both of these programs were written by Jim
Kent at UCSC.
