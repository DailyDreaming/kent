<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track indicates the location of sequences in publications
mapped back to the genome. It is based on data from more than 22.000 articles
with DNA sequences from the <A HREF="http://www.pubmedcentral.com/"
TARGET=_blank>Pubmed Central</A>
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/openftlist.html"
TARGET=_blank>Open-Access archive</A>, which consists of ~130.000 free
research articles (Feb 2010)</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Articles were downloaded from PubMed Central. Depending on availability, XML,
raw ASCII or text extracted from PDFs was used.  The results were then
processed by the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/text2genome/"
TARGET=_blank>text2genome.org</A> software.  It searches for stretches of
separated nucleotide-like letters that are longer than 19bp or words that
contain more than 40% nucleotide-like letters. The DNA resulting sequences
were mapped with BLAST to all genomes that are part of
Ensembl/EnsemblGenomes version 56 and filtered with the text2genome pipeline: 

<UL>
<LI>Hits to NCBI Univec are completely removed</LI>
<LI>Only matches on the most plausible genome are kept. This is the
genome with the most matching sequences which either is mentioned in the
text and recognized by <A HREF="http://www.sf.net/projects/linnaeus/"
TARGET=_blank>LINNAEUS</A> or a well-known model organism.</LI>
<LI>Hits from the same paper that are closer than 50kbp are
chained (shown as exon-blocks on the browser)</LI>
<LI>Non-unique hits are only kept in the chain with the most members</LI>
</UL>
