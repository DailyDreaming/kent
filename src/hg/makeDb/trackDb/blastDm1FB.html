<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track contains tBLASTn alignments of the peptides
from the predicted and known genes identified in the <em>D. melanogaster</em>
FlyBase as of 24 July 2004 to the <EM>$organism</EM> sequence.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
First, predicted proteins from the <em>D. melanogaster</em> FlyBase track were
aligned with the <em>D. melanogaster</em> genome using the blat program to 
discover exon boundaries.  
Next, the amino acid sequences that make up each exon were aligned with the 
<em>$organism</em> sequence using the tBLASTn program.
Finally, the putative <em>$organism</em> exons were chained together using an 
organism-specific maximum gap size but no gap penalty. The single best exon 
chains extending over more than 60% of the query protein were included. Exon 
chains that extended over 60% of the query and matched at least 60% of the 
protein's amino acids were also included.
