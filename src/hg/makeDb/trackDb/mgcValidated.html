<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows <i>validated</i> alignments of $organism mRNAs from the
<a HREF="http://mgc.nci.nih.gov/" TARGET=_blank>Mammalian Gene Collection</a> (MGC)
having full-length open reading frames (ORFs) to the genome.
</p>
<h2>Method</h2>
<p>
GenBank $organism MGC mRNAs identified as having full-length ORFs are
aligned against the genome using the 
<a HREF="../cgi-bin/hgBlat?db=$db" TARGET=_blank>blat</a> 
program. The Blat output is used to select the genomic location of the mRNA. The genomic sequence is then used for a 
refined alignment of the clone using several cDNA-to-genome 
programs. Clones are considered validated when<br>
- all mismatches to the genome are either known SNPs or present in at least 8 other clones in the region<br>
- the ORF of the mRNA can be verified using
<a HREF="http://mblab.wustl.edu/query.html">Twinscan</a> (reference: 
<a HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=11473003">
I. Korf <i>et al</i>, Bioinformatics 2001</a>).<p>

When a single mRNA aligns in multiple places, it is currently discarded. This is an ongoing project: more clones 
will be validated in later stages.<p>
