<H2>Description</H2>
<P>Reference alignment of mouse genome vs. the human genome
constructed from the Mouse Translated Blat Alignments
track.
</P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The track is constructed by selecting the best-scoring 
<A HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656" TARGET=_blank>blat</A> 
alignment for each aligned position in the genome.
Mouse insertions are included in the reference alignment when 
they follow the last base of a blat block, although this process
is not entirely perfected.

<P>This track is produced at UCSC. Mouse sequence data is provided by the 
Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium.</P>
