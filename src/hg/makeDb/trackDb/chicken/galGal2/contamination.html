<H2>Description</H2>

This track shows locations of likely contamination in the assembly, 
i.e. high-scoring alignments of E.coli, vector and maize mitochondrion 
sequence.  The name for each feature indicates the type of contamination 
found there.  

<P>
The maize mitochondrion contamination ("MAIZE_MITO") locations are for 
the entire WGS contig found to be contaminated.  The E.coli and vector 
locations show only the contaminated portion of the affected WGS contig.
