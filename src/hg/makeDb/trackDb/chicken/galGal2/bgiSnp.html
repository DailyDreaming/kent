<H2>Description</H2>

<P>
This track shows Simple Nucleotide Polymorphisms and/or
insertions/deletions (SNPs) determined by the 
<A HREF="http://www.genomics.org.cn/bgi_new/index.htm" TARGET=_BLANK>
Beijing Genomics Institute</A> (BGI).  
Genomic sequence reads from three alternate strains of chicken were 
used to determine the SNPs relative to the reference Chicken assembly 
(Red Jungle Fowl): Broiler, Layer and Silkie.  
When a SNP is associated with a gene annotated by BGI, information
about the association is displayed along with a link to the details
page for the gene.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>
Sequence reads from the Broiler, Layer and Silkie strains were mapped
to the reference Chicken assembly with blast.  Then cross_match was
used for the detailed base-by-base comparison.  The Phred quality
scores (-10 * log_10 estimated error probability) are given for the 
SNP base(s) in the assembly and the SNP read.
