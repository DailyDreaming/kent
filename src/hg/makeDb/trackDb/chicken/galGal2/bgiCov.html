<H2>Description</H2>

<P>
This track shows areas of coverage for genomic regions of 3 alternate 
strains of chicken sequenced by the 
<A HREF="http://www.genomics.org.cn/bgi_new/index.htm" TARGET=_BLANK>
Beijing Genomics Institute</A> (BGI): Broiler, Layer, and Silkie.  
Single reads from those three strains were mapped to the 
reference assembly for Red Jungle Fowl (RJF).

Coverage area names are of the format
