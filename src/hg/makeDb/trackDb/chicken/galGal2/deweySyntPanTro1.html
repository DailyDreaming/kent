<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows exon-anchored synteny blocks for $Organism and 
Chimp (Nov. 2003 - panTro1), taken from a 5-species synteny map 
(chicken, human, chimp, mouse, rat).  
The map is 1-to-1 and symmetric, so segment IDs are common to 
all pairwise tracks generated from the map.
