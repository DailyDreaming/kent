<H2>Description</H2>

<P>
This track shows protein-coding genes annotated by the 
<A HREF="http://www.genomics.org.cn/bgi_new/index.htm" TARGET=_BLANK>
Beijing Genomics Institute</A> (BGI).  When Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms 
and/or insertions/deletions (SNPs) from BGI have been associated 
with a gene, those SNPs are listed with links to their details pages.
