The <em>Drosophila simulans</em> Release 1.0 (Apr. 2005) draft genome sequence 
was produced by the Genome Sequencing Center at the Washington University 
(WUSTL) School of Medicine in St. Louis.

<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of an
mRNA or EST, a chromosomal range, or keywords
from the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list provides
examples of valid position queries for the Drosophila
genome. Note that some position queries (e.g. &quot;huntington&quot;) may return
matches to the mRNA records of other species. In these cases, the
mRNAs are mapped to their homologs in Drosophila.  See the

User's Guide</A> for more information.

<H3>Assembly details</H3>
<P>
The Release 1.0 <em>D. simulans</em> assembly is a "mosaic" consisting
primarily of a ~4X whole genome shotgun assembly of the W501 strain,
with gaps filled in when possible using contigs and unplaced reads from
~1X whole genome shotgun assemblies of 6 other strains: C167V4,
MD106TS, MD199S, NC48S, SIM4, and SIM6.  Mitochondrial sequence was
downloaded separately from Genbank.  Total size, excluding the gapless
14,972bp mitochondrial sequence, is 142,405,747bp including gaps and
127,241,461bp excluding gaps.
<P>
The sequence is distributed among the following chromosomes: 2L, 2R,
2h (random only), 3L, 3R, 3h (random only), 4, X, Xh (random only), Yh
(random only), M (mitochondria) and U.
Sequence that could not be reliably ordered within a chromosome
<em>N</em> has been placed on chr<em>N</em>_random. Heterochromatin
that has been localized to a specific chromosome can be found in
chr<em>N</em>h_random.  For more information about the
<em>D. simulans</em> assembly and statistics, see the WUSTL Genome
