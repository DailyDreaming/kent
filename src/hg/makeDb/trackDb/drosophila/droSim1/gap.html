<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.  These gaps - with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic gaps - may be closed during the
finishing process in future assemblies. 
</P><P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is known, it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap. 
</P>
<P>This assembly contains two types of gaps:
<UL>
<LI><B>Fragment</B> - gaps that are covered by read pairs (hence the 
  approximate gap size is known).
<LI><B>Clone</B> - in chrU or chr*_random, gaps between unordered and 
  unoriented supercontigs; 
  in other chromosomes, gaps between ordered/oriented supercontigs, 
  not covered by read pairs (hence the gap size is not known and an
  arbitrary size is assigned).
</UL></P>
