<H2>Description</H2> <P>
<P>
This track shows a measure of evolutionary conservation in 
7 Drosophila species, mosquito and honeybee,
based on a phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phastCons).
Multiz alignments of the following assemblies were used to generate this
annotation: 
<em>$Organism</em> $date ($db), 
<em>D. simulans</em> Apr. 2005 (droSim1),
<em>D. yakuba</em> Apr. 2004 (droYak1),
<em>D. ananassae</em> Jul. 2004 (droAna1),
<em>D. pseudoobscura</em> Nov. 2004 (dp3),
<em>D. virilis</em> Jul. 2004 (droVir1),
<em>D. mojavensis</em> Aug. 2004 (droMoj1),
<em>A. gambiae</em> Feb. 2003 (anoGam1),
and <em>A. mellifera</em> Jan. 2005 (apiMel2).
</P>
<P>
In full display mode, this track shows the overall conservation score across all
species as well as pairwise alignments of each other species aligned to the 
<em>$Organism</em> genome.  The pairwise alignments are
shown in dense display mode using a grayscale 
density gradient.  The checkboxes in the track configuration section allow
the exclusion of species from the pairwise display; however, this does not
remove them from the conservation score display.  </P>
<P>
When zoomed-in to the base-display level, the track shows the base 
composition of each alignment. The numbers and symbols on the 
&quot;d_melanogaster gap&quot; 
line indicate the lengths of gaps in the human sequence at those 
alignment positions relative to the longest non-<em>$Organism</em> sequence. 
If the gap size is greater than 9, the &quot;+&quot; 
symbol is displayed.  If the gap size is a multiple of 3, the &quot;*&quot; 
symbol is displayed.  
To view detailed information about the 
alignments at a specific position, zoom in the display to 30,000 or fewer bases, 
then click on the alignment.  </P>
<P>
This track may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects 
of the displayed information. Click the &quot;Graph configuration help&quot; link
for an explanation of the configuration options.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P> 
Best-in-genome pairwise alignments were generated for each species 
using blastz, followed by chaining and netting.  The pairwise alignments
were then multiply aligned using the var_multiz program, 
according to this topology:
<PRE><TT>
(((((((dm2 droSim1) droYak1) droAna1) dp3) (droVir1 droMoj1)) anoGam1) apiMel2)
</TT></PRE>
The resulting multiple alignments were then assigned 
conservation scores by phastCons.</P>
<P>
The phastCons program computes conservation scores based on a phylo-HMM, a
type of probabilistic model that describes both the process of DNA
substitution at each site in a genome and the way this process changes from
one site to the next (Felsenstein and Churchill 1996, Yang 1995, Siepel and
Haussler 2005).  PhastCons uses a two-state phylo-HMM, with a state for
conserved regions and a state for non-conserved regions.  The value plotted
at each site is the posterior probability that the corresponding alignment
column was "generated" by the conserved state of the phylo-HMM.  These
scores reflect the phylogeny (including branch lengths) of the species in
question, a continuous-time Markov model of the nucleotide substitution
process, and a tendency for conservation levels to be autocorrelated along
the genome (i.e., to be similar at adjacent sites).  The general reversible
(REV) substitution model was used.  Note that, unlike many
conservation-scoring programs, phastCons does not rely on a sliding window
of fixed size, so short highly-conserved regions and long moderately
conserved regions can both obtain high scores.  More information about
phastCons can be found in Siepel et al. (2005).</P> 
<P> 
PhastCons currently treats alignment gaps as missing data, which
sometimes has the effect of producing undesirably high conservation scores
in gappy regions of the alignment.  We are looking at several possible ways
of improving the handling of alignment gaps.</P>
