This track shows the locations of P transposable element insertions
from

the online database of the

BDGP Gene Disruption Project</A>.
<P>
Triangular arrows indicate the approximate positions in the reference sequence
at which P elements have been inserted. The direction of the arrow 
corresponds to the orientation of the insertion: right-pointing arrows 
indicate forward orientation; left-pointing arrows show backwards insertions.
The item name indicates the strain that has a P element disruption at that 
location.  When a stock order number is available for 
the strain, a link is provided to the Bloomington stock center where 
the strain can be ordered.  
The project's strain library contains more than 7140 strains 
disrupting at least 5362 different genes, corresponding to 39% of the 
13,666 currently annotated Drosophila genes.
