<H2>Description</H2>

This track shows the locations of P transposable element insertions
from 
<A HREF="http://flypush.imgen.bcm.tmc.edu/pscreen/" TARGET=_BLANK>
P-Screen</A>,
the online database of the 
<A HREF="http://www.fruitfly.org/p_disrupt/index.html" TARGET=_BLANK>
BDGP Gene Disruption Project</A>.
The name used for each item is the strain which has a P element
disruption at that location.
The project's strain library contains 1045 strains disrupting at least
1,000 different genes, corresponding to more than 25% of the estimated
3600 genes on the Drosophila autosomes essential for adult viability.
