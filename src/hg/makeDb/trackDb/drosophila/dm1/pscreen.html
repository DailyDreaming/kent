<H2>Description</H2>

This track shows the locations of P transposable element insertions
from 
<A HREF="http://flypush.imgen.bcm.tmc.edu/pscreen/" TARGET=_BLANK>
P-Screen</A>,
the online database of the 
<A HREF="http://www.fruitfly.org/p_disrupt/index.html" TARGET=_BLANK>
BDGP Gene Disruption Project</A>.
The name used for each item is the strain which has a P element
disruption at that location.  When a stock order number is available for 
the strain, a link is provided to the Bloomington stock center where 
the strain can be ordered.  
The project's strain library contains 1045 strains disrupting at least
1,000 different genes, corresponding to more than 25% of the estimated
3600 genes on the Drosophila autosomes essential for adult viability.
