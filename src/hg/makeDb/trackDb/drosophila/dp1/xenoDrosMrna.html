<H2> Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays translated 
<A HREF="../cgi-bin/hgBlat?db=$db" TARGET=_blank>blat</A>
alignments of mRNA for all Drosophila species from Genbank.  </P>

<P>The strand information (+/-) for this track is in two parts.  The
first + indicates the orientation of the query sequence whose
translated protein produced the match (here always 5' to 3', hence +).
The second + or - indicates the orientation of the matching 
translated genomic sequence (+ or -).


<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
mRNAs for all Drosophila species are aligned against the genome using the 
<A HREF="../cgi-bin/hgBlat?db=$db" TARGET=_blank>blat</A>
program.  blat is run in translated mode.  
When a single mRNA aligns in multiple places, only
the best alignments which also have at least 25% sequence identity are kept.

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
The all-Drosphila mRNA track is produced at UCSC from mRNA sequence data
submitted to the international public sequence databases by 
scientists worldwide.</P>
