<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The All-Drosophila RefSeq Genes track shows known protein coding genes 
for all Drosophila species taken from mRNA 
reference sequences compiled at LocusLink. Coding exons are represented by 
blocks connected by horizontal lines representing introns. The 5' and 3' 
untranslated regions (UTRs) are displayed as shorter blocks on the leading 
and trailing ends of the aligning regions. In full display mode, arrowheads 
on the connecting intron lines indicate the direction of transcription.

<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
Refseq mRNAs for all Drosophila species are aligned against the genome using the 
<A HREF="../cgi-bin/hgBlat?db=$db" TARGET=_blank>blat</A>
program.  blat is run in translated mode.  
When a single mRNA aligns in multiple places, only
the best alignments which also have at least 25% sequence identity 
and cover at least 30% of the mRNA are kept.

The All-Drosophila RefSeq Genes track is produced at UCSC from mRNA
sequence data generated by scientists worldwide and curated by the
NCBI <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/RefSeq/" TARGET=_blank>RefSeq
project</A>.
