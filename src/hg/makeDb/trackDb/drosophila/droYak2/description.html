The <em>Drosophila yakuba</em> Release 2.0 (Nov. 2005) draft genome sequence 
was produced by the Genome Sequencing Center at the Washington University 
(WUSTL) School of Medicine in St. Louis.

<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of an
mRNA or EST, a chromosomal range, or keywords
from the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list provides
examples of valid position queries for the Drosophila
genome. Note that some position queries (e.g. &quot;huntington&quot;) may return
matches to the mRNA records of other species. In these cases, the
mRNAs are mapped to their homologs in Drosophila.  See the

The Release 2.0 <em>D. yakuba</em> whole genome shotgun assembly raw data
consists of 8,362 supercontigs larger than 1 kb, with a total size of
approximately 161 Mb and an N50 length of about 2.5 Mb. The total
number of contigs greater than 1 kb is 11,806, with a total size of
approximately 161 Mb and an N50 length of 119kb. The whole genome
shotgun assembly data include raw shotgun data as well as data from
two rounds of automated, directed read selection for improving
sequence quality and extending into and closing gaps.
<P>
The sequence is distributed among the following chromosomes: 2L, 2R, 
2h, 3L, 3R, 3h, 4, X, Xh, Yh, M (mitochondria) and U. Sequence that
could not be reliably ordered within a chromosome N has been placed on
chrN_random. Heterochromatin that has been localized to a specific
chromosome can be found in chrNh or ChrNh_random.  The data were
intially assembled using PCAP 
(<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=12952883&query_hl=7"
TARGET=_BLANK>Huang et al. (2003)</A>). 
To create chromosomal assignments and ordering along the
chromosomes, WUSTL first identified regions of the <em>D. yakuba</em> assembly
that uniquely aligned with the <em>D. melanogaster</em> genome. The <em>D. yakuba</em>
contigs were initially ordered, then, by their position along the
assigned <em>D. melanogaster</em> chromosomes (or segments for the
heterochromatin). Alignment of all <em>D. melanogaster</em> mRNAs against the
<em>D. yakuba</em> assembly were used to confirm these DNA-based alignments.
WUSTL then introduced the inversions indicated by the <em>D. yakuba</em> sequence
assembly to create the <em>D. yakuba</em> chromosomal files. The number of
inversions required and the resulting banding patterns are in good
agreement with the number and patterns expected based on polytene
chromosome banding data from
