<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows expression data from <A HREF="http://www.gnf.org"
TARGET=_blank">GNF</A> (The Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research 
Foundation) using <A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com"

Chipset information is available using the Filter control.</P>  

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
For detailed information about the experiments, see Su <em>et al.</em>, 
<A HREF="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/99/7/4465"
TARGET=_blank>Large-scale analysis of the human and mouse 
transcriptomes</A>, 
<I>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA</I> <B>99</B>(7), 4465-70 (2002). Alignments 
displayed on the track correspond to the target sequences used by 
Affymetrix from which to choose probes.</P> 
<P>
In dense display mode, the track color denotes the average signal over all
experiments on a log base 2 scale. Lighter colors correspond to lower 
signals and darker colors correspond to higher signals. In full display
mode, the color of each item represents the log base 2 ratio of the signal 
of that particular experiment to the median signal of all experiments for 
that probe.</P>
<P>
More information about individual probes and probe sets is available on the
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manual/probe_set_display_manual.affx"
