<H2>Description</H2>
<P>A valid pair of fosmid end sequences must be
at least 32Kb but no more than 47Kb away from each other. 
The orientation of the first fosmid end sequence must be "+" and
the orientation of the second fosmid end sequence must be "-".</P>

<H2>Methods</H2> <P> End sequences were trimmed at the NCBI using
ssahaCLIP written by Jim Mullikin.  Trimmed fosmid end sequences are
placed on the assembled sequence using Jim Kent's BLAT program. </P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P> Sequencing of the fosmid ends was done at the <A HREF="http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/" TARGET=_blank>Whitehead Institute</A>.
Sequences and quality scores are available in the <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?" TARGET=_blank>NCBI trace respository</A>.
