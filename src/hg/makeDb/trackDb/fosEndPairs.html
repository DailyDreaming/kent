<H2>Description</H2>
<P>A valid pair of fosmid end sequences must be
at least 20Kb but no more than 100Kb away from each other. 
The orientation of the first fosmid end sequence must be "+" and
the orientation of the second fosmid end sequence must be "-".</P>

<H2>Methods</H2> <P> End sequences were trimmed based on quality
scores such that the resulting sequence is the longest contiguous
stretch of bases all with quality scores of 19 or above.  resulting
sequences must be at least 15 base pairs.  Trimmed fosmid end
sequences are placed on the assembled sequence using Jim Kent's BLAT
program. </P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P> Sequencing of the fosmid ends was done at the Whitehead Institute.
Sequeces and quality scores are available in the trace respository at
the NCBI.
