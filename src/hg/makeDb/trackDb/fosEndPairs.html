<H2>Description</H2>
<P>A valid pair of fosmid end sequences must be
at least 32Kb but no more than 47Kb away from each other. 
The orientation of the first fosmid end sequence must be "+" and
the orientation of the second fosmid end sequence must be "-".</P>

<H2>Methods</H2> <P> End sequences were trimmed at the NCBI using
ssahaCLIP written by Jim Mullikan.  Trimmed fosmid end sequences are
placed on the assembled sequence using Jim Kent's BLAT program. </P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P> Sequencing of the fosmid ends was done at the Whitehead Institute.
Sequences and quality scores are available in the trace respository at
the NCBI.
