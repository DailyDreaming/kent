<H2>Description</H2>
<P>A valid pair of fosmid end sequences must be
at least 32Kb but no more than 47Kb away from each other. 
The orientation of the first fosmid end sequence must be &quot;+&quot; and
the orientation of the second fosmid end sequence must be &quot;-&quot;.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2> <P> End sequences were trimmed at the NCBI using
ssahaCLIP written by Jim Mullikin.  Trimmed fosmid end sequences are
placed on the assembled sequence using Jim Kent's 
<A HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656" TARGET=_blank>blat</A> 
program. </P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P> Sequencing of the fosmid ends was done at the 
<A HREF="http://www.broad.mit.edu/" TARGET=_blank>Eli & Edythe L. Broad Institute</A> of MIT 
and Harvard University.
Sequences and quality scores are available in the <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?" TARGET=_blank>NCBI Trace Respository</A>.
