<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track displays the level of conservation for each of 12 zoo
species based on <A HREF="http://bio.cse.psu.edu/dist/blastz.pdf" TARGET=_blank>blastz</A> pairwise alignments.</p>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<p>
Blastz pairwise alignments were performed between the NISC-generated
sequence for each species and the UCSC compiled human reference
sequence.
All sequences were RepeatMasked, with repetitive sequences denoted
by lower-case letters. The blastz program will not initiate alignments
within repetative regions, but it will extend alignments into
repetitive
regions.</p>
<p>
Gray horizontal bars denote a mapping/sequencing gap. A percent
identity
less than 50% is not shown since it falls below the minimum y-axis
value.

for running the blastz alignments, putting the data in the proper
format, and for helpful discussions.
