This directory contains the track database for
the UCSC human genome browser.  The program
hgTrackDb converts the information here into
a 'trackDb' table in the hgN MySQL database.

The bulk of the information about a track is
contained in the trackDb.ra file.  Tracks are
separated from each other in this file by 
a blank line.  Each line begins with an
attribute name and is followed by attribute
value.

The html text about a track is in separate
files named xxx.html where xxx is a
track name.   

There may be subdirectories for each organism such
as 'mouse', and underneath these directories for
each database, such as 'hg7'.  There are a trackDb.ra 
file and xxx.html files in these subdirectories.
Tracks descriptions in the subdirectory will
over-ride track descriptions in the parent directory.
This allows you to customize a track for
each version of the database.

After editing a track definition here
don't forget to run hgTrackDb to bring
it into the MySQL database.  To update
your personal copy (on hgwdev-userName) do
    make update
to do it on genome-test do
    make alpha

Most of the fields in the track.ra file should 
be reasonably self explanitory.  A notable exception
is the type field.  Currently there are six types:
bed, psl, and genePred.  Here is the format of these
type fields:
For bed types it's always three words as follows:
   1) bed (always)
   2) fieldCount - the number of standard fields
   3) extraInfo - either '.' meaning no non-standard fields
       or '+' if there are additional non-standard fields.
For psl types it's
   1) psl
   2) subtype, which is either
        .  (just regular human mRNA)
        est    (human displays a little differently in dense mode)
        xeno (cross species)
   3) Optional extra parameter for xeno subtype: database associated
      with other organism.  If present the display can be colored by
      chromosome and the chromosome and position in kilobases is shown
      as the item label.
For gene predictions; use `.' when a positional parameter must be skipped.
    1) genePred
    2) (optional) associated protein sequence table
    3) (optional) associated mRNA table.
For chains it's
    1) chain
    2) database for other organism 
For nets it's
    1) chain
    2) database for other organism
    3) associated chain track
For sample
    1) sample
    2) minVal (optional, default 0).  Used just for label.
    3) maxVal (optional, default 1000).  Used just for label.
    4) scale - what to scale samples that
       min and max values in database end up
       0 and 1.
    2) number of fields (currently always 9)
For expRatio
    Nothing follows expRatio, but the following fields
    must be defined elsewhere in the .ra record:
       expTable - table in hgFixed with names of experiments etc.
       expScale - maximum expression value
       expStep - amount to step in visible expression scale.  Some
           round number close to expScale/8 is best
       chip - Name of microarray chip.
For wigMaf tracks:
    o track name is table name of the multiple alignment maf table,
        with associated maf file in /gbdb (loaded with hgLoadMaf)
    o type line includes data value range for conservation wiggle,
         as for wig track 
    o standard wig track settings may be included (e.g. 
        maxHeightPixels, yLineOnOff, autoScaleDefault).  These
        apply to both conservation and pairwise wiggles
    o wiggle setting - contains table name of conservation wiggle 
                          (loaded with hgLoadWiggle)
    o species order - specifies the order of each pairwise items in the display
    o pairwise setting - contains suffix of the pairwise maf tables.
            The prefix is generated from the species name.
            An underscore is used to separate (e.g. chimp_hmrg if
            setting is "hmrg").  If there is a wig table named
            <species>_<suffix>_wig, this is used for pairwise display.
            In this case, the wiggle height for the pairwise can
            be specified as the last word on this line.
            (e.g. pairwise CFTR 20, will have 20 pixel height of
            pairwise wiggle from tables named <species>_CFTR_wig).
    
If something lacks a type field it needs to have custom
display routines.   You can remove a track from the
browser by removing it from the .ra file and doing
a make update.

The shortLabel and longLabel fields may have the following
variables, which will be substituted:
     $ORGANISM - all upper case organism, like 'MOUSE'
     $Organism - initial capped organism, like 'Mouse'
     $organism - all lower case organism, like 'mouse'
     $db - database (like mm3, hg15, etc.)
     $date - freeze date of underlying assembly
     $blurb - If there is a blurb field in the .ra file this echos it.
In addition if there is a $otherDb field set in the .ra file these
variables are available
     $o_ORGANISM - all upper case other organism, like 'MOUSE'
     $o_Organism - initial capped other organism, like 'Mouse'
     $o_organism - all lower case other organism, like 'mouse'
     $o_db - other database (like mm3, hg15, etc.)
     $o_date - freeze date of underlying other assembly

If there is a colorChromDefault field (values "on" or "off"), it
is used to set the default value for chromosome coloring
in affected tracks (type psl xeno <db>).  Without the field,
the default is "on".

All ra fields that are not explictly handled in trackDbCustom.c:trackDbAddInfo 
are added to the trackDb->settingsHash table.

Some settings used by various tracks:
    o exonArrows - if speciufied to draw strand arrows on exons.
    o itemAttrIdTbl - table used to color individual items in a track, selected
      by numeric id.
