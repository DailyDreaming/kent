<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track displays alignments of the human genome vs.
the mouse genome.</P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The alignments were done with BLAT in translated protein mode
using the parameters -q=dnax -t=dnax and otherwise the default
settings. Both genomes were masked with RepeatMasker and Tandem Repeat 
Finder before running BLAT.  Places where more than 250 alignments happened
over the same place were filtered out.  Beware of alignments of greater than 
97% identity: these may reflect mouse contamination in the human genome or
human contamination in the mouse genome.</P>
<H2>Data Release Policy</H2>
<P>This data is made available before scientific publication with the 
following understanding:
<OL>
<LI>The data may be freely downloaded, used in analyses, and 
repackaged in databases.
<LI>Users are free to use the data in scientific papers analyzing 
particular genes and regions if the providers of this data 
(the Mouse Sequencing Consortium) are properly acknowledged.
<LI>The Centers producing the data reserve the right to publish the initial 
large-scale analyses of the dataset-including large-scale identification 
of regions of evolutionary conservation and large-scale 
genomic assembly. Large-scale refers to regions with size on the order of 
a chromosome (that is, 30 Mb or more). 
<LI>Any redistribution of the data should carry this notice.</OL>
