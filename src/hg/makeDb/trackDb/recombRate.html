<H2>Description</H2> 
<P> The recombination rate track represents
calculated sex-averaged rates of recombination based on either the
deCODE, Marshfield, or Genethon genetic maps.  By default, the deCODE
map rates are displayed.  Female- and male-specific recombination
rates, and well as rates from the Marshfield and Genethon maps, can
also be displayed by choosing the appropriate filter option on the track description page.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P> The deCODE genetic map was created at 
<a href="http://www.decode.com/" TARGET=_blank>deCODE Genetics</a> and is 
based on 5,136 microsatellite markers for 146 families with a total
of 1,257 meiotic events.  For more information on this map, see
A. Kong et. al., &quot;<a href="http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/ng/journal/v31/n3/abs/ng917.html" TARGET=_blank>A high-resolution recombination map of the human genome</a>&quot;, 
<em>Nature Genetics</em>, 31(3), pages 241-247 (2002).
</P>
<P> The Marshfield genetic map was created at the <a
href="http://research.marshfieldclinic.org/genetics/Map_Markers/maps/IndexMapFrames.html" TARGET=_blank>Center
for Medical Genetics</a> and is based on 8,325 short tandem repeat
polymorphisms (STRPs) for 8 CEPH families consisting of 134
individuals with 186 meioses.  For more information on this map,
see K.W. Broman et. al.,

</P>
<P> The Genethon genetic map was created at <a
href="http://www.genethon.fr/php/index_us.php" TARGET=_blank>Genethon</a> and is
based on 5,264 microsatellites for 8 CEPH families consisting of 134
individuals with 186 meioses.  For more information on this map,

Based on 5,264 Microsatellites&quot;, <em>Nature</em>, 380, pages 152-154
(1996).
</P>
<P> Each base is assigned the recombination rate calculated by
assuming a linear genetic distance across the immediately flanking
genetic markers. The recombination rate assigned to each 1Mb window
is the average recombination rate of the bases contained within the
window.

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>To view a particular map or gender-specific rate, select the corresponding
option from the &quot;Map Distances&quot; pulldown list. By default, the browser 
displays the deCODE sex-averaged distances.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>This track is produced at UCSC and uses data that are freely available for
the Genethon, Marshfield, and deCODE genetic maps (see above links).  Thanks
to all who have played a part in the creation of these maps. </P>
