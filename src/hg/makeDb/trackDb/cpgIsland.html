<H2> Description </H2>
<P>
CpG islands are associated with genes, particularly housekeeping
genes, in vertebrates.  CpG islands are particularly common near
transcription start sites, and may be associated with promoter
regions.  Normally a C followed immediately by a G (a CpG) is rare in
vertebrate DNA because the C's in such an arrangement tend to be
methylated.  This methylation helps distinguish the newly synthesized
DNA strand from the parent strand, which aids in the final stages of
DNA proofreading after duplication.  However, over evolutionary time
methylated C's tend to turn into T's because of spontaneous
deamination.  The result is that CpG's are relatively rare unless
there is selective pressure to keep them or a region is not methylated
for some reason, perhaps having to do with the regulation of gene
expression.  CpG islands are regions where CpG's are present at
significantly higher levels than is typical for the genome as a whole.

<H2> Method </H2>
<P>
CpG islands were predicted by searching the sequence one base at a
time, scoring each dinucleotide (+17 for CG and -1 for others) and
identifying maximally scoring segments.  Each segment was then
evaluated to determine GC content (>=50%), length (>200), and ratio of
observed proportion of CG dinucleotides to the expected proportion on
the basis of the GC content of the segment (>0.6).
