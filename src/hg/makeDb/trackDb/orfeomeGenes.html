<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
ORFeome $organism clones were obtained from Genbank and aligned against the
genome using the blat program. When a single clones aligned in multiple places,
the alignment having the highest base identity was found.  Only alignments
having a base identity level within 0.5% of the best and at least 96% base
identity with the genomic sequence were kept.
