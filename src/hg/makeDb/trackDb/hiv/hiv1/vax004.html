<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The VAX004 Sequence track shows VAX004 HIV-1 gp120 nucleotide sequences aligned against the base genome.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
VAX004 HIV-1 gp120 nucleotide sequences 
were aligned to the base genome using BLAT.
The resulting alignments with minimum identity of 80% and BLAT score equal or better than 200 were used to construct this track.
<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
This track was produced at UCSC.
