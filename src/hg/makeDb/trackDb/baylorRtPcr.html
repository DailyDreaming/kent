<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
$Organism Sequences obtained through RT-PCR rescue of refseqs carried out at Baylor as a
part of the effort by <A HREF="http://mgc.nci.nih.gov/" TARGET=_blank>MGC</A>
MGC to provide a full-ORF clone from all $organism genes.
<P>
These sequences were obtained from clones which were deemed unacceptable
since they contained at least one amino acid substitution as compared with
refseq.  However, when compared with the genome sequence via BLAT it was
found that the genome had the identical nucleotide sequence at that
position.  We beleive that some of the sequences which fail from the refseq
match can be resurrected via the genome match if the amino acid change is
likely to be a variant.
<P>
The sequences which are in one of the following three categories
<OL>
<LI> Perfect match with genome no change in ORF or splicing.

<LI> Perfect match with genome, appears to be an alternate splice product.

<LI> Matches genome at position of a.a. substitution (from refseq
comparison) but mismatches outside ORF.
</OL>
