<H2>Description</H2>

<P>
 The second draft assembly of the Fugu genome consists of 12,403 contigs,
 or scaffolds. The individual contigs sizes range from 2-650Kbp.
 The draft sequence of Fugu Genome available covers 320 Mbases of DNA
 sequence. 
We estimate that this covers approximately 90% of the non-repetitive fraction
 of the genome (which has a total size, including repeats, of around
 365Mbases).
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The alignments were done 
with BLAT in translated protein mode requiring 2 nearby 4-mer matches
to trigger a detailed alignment.  The human
genome was masked with RepeatMasker and Tandem Repeat Finder before 
running BLAT. </P>
