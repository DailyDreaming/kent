<P>
CpG islands are associated with genes, particularly housekeeping
genes, in vertebrates.  CpG islands are typically common near
transcription start sites, and may be associated with promoter
regions.  Normally a C (cytosine) base followed immediately by a 
G (guanine) base (a CpG) is rare in
vertebrate DNA because the C's in such an arrangement tend to be
methylated.  This methylation helps distinguish the newly synthesized
DNA strand from the parent strand, which aids in the final stages of
DNA proofreading after duplication.  However, over evolutionary time
methylated C's tend to turn into T's because of spontaneous
deamination.  The result is that CpG's are relatively rare unless
there is selective pressure to keep them or a region is not methylated
for some reason, perhaps having to do with the regulation of gene
expression.  CpG islands are regions where CpG's are present at
significantly higher levels than is typical for the genome as a whole.

The CpG count is the number of CG dinucleotides in the island.  
The Percentage CpG is the ratio of CpG nucleotide bases
(twice the CpG count) to the length.

A sliding-window search is performed on the set of CpG locations in 
the genome, to find the longest spans that meet the criteria given in
