TWINSCAN predictions proposed for exploratory PCR confirmation.

<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
Multi-exon TWINSCAN predictions that
<OL>
<LI> do not overlap <EM>MGC genes</EM> or <EM>MGC in progress</EM> ESTs and
<LI> fail to have any splice site supported by a human EST or mRNA, except
     for ESTs or mRNAs that also map to another prediction nearly as well.
