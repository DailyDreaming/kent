<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
TWINSCAN predictions proposed for exploratory PCR confirmation.
</P>
<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
Multi-exon TWINSCAN predictions that
<OL>
<LI> do not overlap <EM>MGC genes</EM> or <EM>MGC in progress</EM> ESTs.
<LI> fail to have any splice site supported by a human EST or mRNA, except
     for ESTs or mRNAs that also map to another prediction nearly as well.
<LI> do not overlap MGC A-list
<LI> are not <EM>inside</EM> any Genbank human mRNA. 
</OL>

<EM>inside</EM> means [begin, end] of the alignment of a genbank human mRNA
contains the [begin, end] of a Twinscan prediction.
