<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays translated 
<A HREF="../cgi-bin/hgBlat?db=$db" TARGET=_blank>blat</A>
alignments of non-$organism vertebrate ESTs from 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html" 
TARGET=_blank>GenBank</A>. </P>

<P>The strand information (+/-) for this track is in two parts.  The
first + or - indicates the orientation of the query sequence whose
translated protein produced the match.  The second + or - indicates the
orientation of the matching translated genomic sequence.  Because the two
orientations of a DNA sequence give different predicted protein sequences,
there are four combinations.  ++ is not the same as --; nor is +- the same
as -+.

<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
To generate this track, the ESTs are aligned against the genome using the blat
program. The alignments are passed through a piecewise near-best-in-genome
filter.</P>

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>The track filter can be used to change the color or include/exclude a subset of 
individual items within a track. This is helpful when many items are shown in the 
track display, especially when only some are relevant to the current task. To use the
filter:
<OL>
<LI>Enter a value in one or more of the text boxes to filter the EST display. For
example, to apply the filter to all ESTs expressed in the liver, type &quot;liver&quot; in the 
tissue box. For a list of permissible filter values, consult the non-positional table in
the Table Browser that corresponds to the factor on which you wish to filter. For
example, the non-positional table &quot;tissue&quot; contains all of the types of tissues
that can be entered into the tissue text box. Wildcards can also be used in the
filter.
<LI>If filtering on more than one value, choose the desired combination
logic. If &quot;and&quot; is selected, only ESTs that match all of the filter criteria will
be highlighted. If &quot;or&quot; is selected, ESTs that match any 1 of the filter criteria
will be highlighted.
<LI>Choose the color or display characteristic that should be used to highlight or
include/exclude the filtered items. If &quot;exclude&quot; is chosen, the browser will not 
display ESTs that match the filter criteria. If &quot;include&quot; is selected, the browser 
will display only those ESTs that match the filter criteria.
</OL></P>
<P>When you have finished configuring the filter, click the <em>Submit</em> button.</P>
