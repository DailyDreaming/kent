<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays genomic mappings for $organism LongSAGE tags from the <A
HREF="http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/" TARGET=_blank>The Cancer Genome Anatomy
Project</A>.  SAGE (Serial Analysis of Gene Expression) [Velculescu 1995] is a
quantitative technique for measuring gene expression. For a brief overview
of SAGE, see the <a
href="http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/SAGE/SAGEInformation" TARGET=_blank>CGAP SAGE
information page</A>.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
Genomic mappings of 17-base LongSAGE tags are displayed.  Tag counts are
normalized to tags per million (TPM) in each library.  Tags with higher TPM are
more darkly shaded.  The <TT>CATG</TT> restriction site before the start of the tag
is rendered as a thick line; the 17 bases of the tag are drawn as a thinner
line.  Thus the thin end points in the direction of transcription.

The track display modes are:
<UL>
<LI> <B>dense</B> - Draws locations of mapped tags on a single line.
<LI> <B>squish</B> - Draws one item per tag per tissue without labels.
<LI> <B>pack</B> - Draws one item per tag per tissue with labels. The label
includes the number of libraries containing the tag.
Clicking on an item lists the libraries containing the tag, with the libraries
from the particular tissue in bold.  Clicking on a library in the lists
displays detailed information about that library.
<LI> <B>full</B> - Draws one item per tag per library.
Clicking on an item displays information about the library, along with other
libraries containing the tag.
</UL>
</P>
<P>
The track can be configured to display only tags from a selected tissue or a
selected library.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Tag and library data, along with genomic mappers, were obtained
from <A HREF="http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/" TARGET=_blank>The Cancer Genome Anatomy Project</A>.
</P>
<P>
Information about the various SAGE libraries, data downloads and other tools
for exploring and analyzing this data is available from the
<A HREF="http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/SAGE" TARGET=_blank>CGAP SAGE Genie</A> web site.
</P>

<H4>Mapping SAGE tags to the human genome</H4>
<P>
First, a subset of all single-base SNPs from dbSNP were gathered.  The SNPs 
discarded include those which have flanking sequence that does not map to a 
unique location, SNPs with the reference allele not matching the reference
genome, and SNPs that overlap tandom repeat sequence. For all 21-mers in the
genome: if the 21-mer contained a SNP or
multiple SNPs, we created all possible versions of the 21-mer using all
combinations of SNPs.  We used 21-mers beginning with CATG as a mapping.
We discarded mappings that are not seen in the SAGE tag dataset.
Finally, we discarded any non-unique mappings.
</P>

<H4>Human Embryonic Stem Cell library construction</H4>
<P>
Detailed information regarding the human ESC lines used in this study can be
found at <A HREF="http://stemcells.nih.gov" TARGET=_blank>http://stemcells.nih.gov</A> and in Hirst, et al. 2007.
The ESC tags were generated from RNA purified from human ESCs maintained under
conditions that promote their maintenance in an undifferentiated state.
</P>

<P>
A complete set of embryonic stem cell LongSAGE tags are available through the
<A HREF="http://www.transcriptomes.org" TARGET=_blank>BCCA-GSC embryonic stem cell
transcriptomes web site</A> and through the <A
HREF="http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/SAGE" TARGET=_blank>CGAP web portal</A>.
