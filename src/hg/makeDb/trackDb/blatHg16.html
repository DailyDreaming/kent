<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track displays alignments of the $o_date $o_Organism genome vs.
the $Organism genome.</P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The alignments were done with 
<A HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656" TARGET=_blank>BLAT</A> 
in translated protein mode
using the parameters <em>-q=dnax</em> <em>-t=dnax</em>. The default
settings were used otherwise. Both genomes were masked with 
<A HREF="http://www.repeatmasker.org" TARGET=_blank>RepeatMasker</A> and Tandem Repeat 
Finder before running BLAT.</P>
<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>This track is produced at UCSC.
