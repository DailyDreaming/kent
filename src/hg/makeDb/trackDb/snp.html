<H2>Visualization Controls</H2>

  Variants can be drawn in color based on their source, molecule type,
  variant class, validation stauts, or functional classification.
  Variants can also be excluded from the list based on these same

<H2>Filtering</H2>
<P>
  The SNPs in this track include all known polymorphisms that can be
  mapped against the current assembly that are available in the
  current build of <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/"
  TARGET=_blank>dbSnp</A>, which is shown in the Genome Browser 
  <A HREF="/goldenPath/releaseLog.html">release log</A>.
</P>

<P>
  There are two reasons that some variants may not be mapped and/or
  annotated in this track:
  <UL>
    <LI> 
      Submissions that are completely masked as repetitive elements.
      These are dropped from any further computations. This set of
      reference SNPs is found in chromosome &quot;rs_chMasked&quot; on
      the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/" TARGET=_blank>dbSNP
      ftp site</A>.
    </LI>
    <LI>
      Submissions that are defined in a cDNA context with extensive
      splicing. These SNPs are typically annotated on refSeq mRNAs
      through a separate annotation process. Effort is being made to
      reverse map these variations back to contig coordinates, but
      that has not been implemented. For now, you can find this set of
      variations in &quot;rs_chNotOn&quot; on the <A
      HREF="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/" TARGET=_blank>dbSNP ftp
      site</A>.  
    </LI>
  </UL>
</P>

<P>
  The heuristics for the non-SNP variations (i.e. named elements and
  STRs) are quite conservative; therefore, some of these are probably
  lost. This approach was chosen to avoid false annotation of
  variation in inappropriate locations.
