<H2>Description</H2>
This track shows rat/$organism genomic alignments using
a gap scoring system that allows longer gaps than traditional
affine gap scoring systems.   It can also tolerate gaps
in both rat and $organism simultaniously.  These &quot;double-sided&quot;
gaps can be caused by local inversions and overlapping deletions
in both species.

<H2>Methods</H2>
Transposons that have been inserted since the rat/$organism
split are removed,  and the resulting abbreviated genomes are
aligned with blastz.  The transposons are then put back into the
alignments.  The resulting alignments are converted into axt format
and the resulting axts are fed into axtChain.  AxtChain organizes all 
the alignments between a single rat and a single $organism chromosome,
into a group,  and makes a kd-tree out of all the gapless subsections
(blocks) of the alignments.  Next, maximally scoring chains of these
blocks are found by running a dynamic program over the kd-tree.  Chains
scoring below a threshold are discarded, and the remaining chains are
displayed here.
