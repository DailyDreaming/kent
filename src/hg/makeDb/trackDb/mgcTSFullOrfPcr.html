<P>
TWINSCAN predictions proposed for full-ORF PCR confirmation
</P>
<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
Multi-exon TWINSCAN predictions that
<OL>
<LI> do not overlap <EM>MGC genes</EM> or <EM>MGC in progress</EM> ESTs
<LI> do have at least one intron supported by a human EST or mRNA that does not map to any other prediction nearly as well
<LI> do not overlap MGC A-list and 
<LI> are not 'inside' any Genbank human mRNA. 
</OL>

<EM>inside</EM> means [begin, end] of the alignment of a genbank human mRNA
contains the [begin, end] of a Twinscan prediction.
