<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
NCBI recently announced a new release of
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/functionalelements/" 
target="_blank"> functional regulatory elements</a>.

NCBI is now providing 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/" target="_blank" >RefSeq</a> and 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/" target="_blank" >Gene</a>
records for non-genic functional elements that have been described in the literature and are 
experimentally validated. Elements in scope include experimentally-verified gene regulatory 
regions (e.g., enhancers, silencers, locus control regions), known structural elements
(e.g., insulators, DNase I hypersensitive sites, matrix/scaffold-associated regions), 
well-characterized DNA replication origins, and clinically-significant sites of DNA recombination
and genomic instability. Priority is given to genomic regions that are implicated in human disease 
or are otherwise of significant interest to the research community. Currently, the scope of this 
project is restricted to human and mouse. The current scope does not include functional elements
predicted from large-scale epigenomic mapping studies, nor elements based on disease-associated 
variation

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
This track follows the display conventions for 
<a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/bigBed.html" target="_blank">big bed</a> 
files.  Black bars indicate functional elements, the elements are labeled with 
their sequence ontology term.  
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This track was built from the NCBI refSeq gff3 file aquired from their
<a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/H_sapiens/GFF_interim/" target="_blank"> ftp server</a>.
The gff3 file was joined with the UCSC table ucscToRefSeq to get the UCSC chromosome name.
The file was then converted to a bed file then into bigBed for display.

This track was prepared by Chris Eisenhart and Angie Hinrichs with curation
from the NCBI team.
