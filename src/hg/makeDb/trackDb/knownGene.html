<H2>Description</H2>
The Known Genes track shows known protein coding genes based on 
proteins from SWISS-PROT, TrEMBL, and TrEMBL-NEW and their
corresponding mRNAs from Genbank.
Coding exons are displayed 
taller than 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTR). Connecting introns 
are one-pixel lines with hatch marks indicating direction of transcription.
Entries which have corresponding entries in PDB are colored black.
Entries which either have corresponding proteins in SWISS-PROT or mRNAs that are 
NCBI Reference Sequences with a "Reviewed" status are colored dark blue.
Entries which have mRNAs that are 
NCBI Reference Sequences with a "Provisional" status are colored lighter blue.
Everything else is colored with lightest blue.
<H2>Method</H2>
All mRNAs of a species are aligned against the genome using the BLAT
program.  When a single mRNA aligns in multiple places, only
the best alignments are kept.  The alignments must also have 
at least 98% sequence identity to be kept.  
This set of mRNA alignments is further reduced by keeping only those mRNAs that 
are referenced by a protein in SWISS-PROT, TrEMBL, or TrEMBL-NEW.
<P>
Among multiple mRNAs referenced by a single protein, the best mRNA is chosen based on 
a quality score, which depends on its length, how good its translation matches 
the protein sequence, and its release date.
The list of mRNA and protein pairs are further cleaned up by removing 
short invalid entries and consolidating entries with identical CDS regions.
<P>
Finally, RefSeq entries which are derived from DNA sequences instead of 
mRNA sequences are added.
<H2>Credits</H2>
The Known Genes track is produced at UCSC based primarily on cross-references 
between proteins from 
<A HREF="http://www.expasy.org/sprot/">SWISS-PROT</A> 
(also including TrEMBL and TrEMBL-NEW) and mRNAs from Genbank
generated by scientists worldwide.  Part of 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/">NCBI RefSeq</A> 
data are also included in this track.
