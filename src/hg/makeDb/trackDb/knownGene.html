<H2>Description</H2>
The Known Genes track shows known protein coding genes based on 
proteins from SWISS-PROT, TrEMBL, and TrEMBL-NEW and their
corresponding mRNAs from Genbank.
Coding exons are displayed 
taller than 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTR). Connecting introns 
are one-pixel lines with hatch marks indicating direction of transcription.
Entries which have corresponding entries in PDB are colored black.
Entries which either have corresponding proteins in SWISS-PROT or mRNAs that are 
NCBI Reference Sequences with a "Reviewed" status are colored dark blue.
Entries which have mRNAs that are 
NCBI Reference Sequences with a "Provisional" status are colored lighter blue.
Everything else is colored with lightest blue.
<H2>Method</H2>
First, all mRNAs of a species are aligned against the genome using the BLAT
program.  When a single mRNA aligns in multiple places, only
the best alignments are kept.  The alignments must also have 
at least 98% sequence identity to be kept.  
This set of mRNA alignments is further reduced by keeping only those mRNAs that 
are referenced by a protein in SWISS-PROT, TrEMBL, or TrEMBL-NEW.
<P>
Among multiple mRNAs referenced by a single protein, the best mRNA is chosen based on 
a quality score, which depends on its length, how good its translation matches 
the protein sequence, and its release date.
<P> 
Finally the list of mRNA and protein pairs are further cleaned up by removing 
short invalid entries and consolidating entries with identical CDS regions.
<H2>Credits</H2>
The Known Genes track is produced at UCSC based on cross-references between proteins 
from <A HREF="http://www.expasy.org/sprot/">SWISS-PROT</A> 
(also including TrEMBL and TrEMBL-NEW) and mRNAs from Genbank
generated by scientists worldwide.
