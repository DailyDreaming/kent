<P>
This track shows the orientation of the whole genome shotgun (WGS) contigs of the 
March 2005 $organism 2.0 assembly from 
<A HREF="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/bovine" TARGET=_blank>Baylor Medical College</A>.
For oriented contigs, the score is 1000 and will be colored black.
For unoriented contigs, the score is 500 and will be colored grey.
Since this is a draft assembly, knowing which contigs were still
considered "#unorientedScaffold" in the agp file may be useful.
Note that this sort of orientation data does not apply to chrBin0 and scaffolds.
