<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of a
sequenced mRNA or EST, a scaffold coordinate range, a gene identifier, or 
keywords from 
the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list shows 
examples of valid position queries for the ciona genome.
