<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track displays alignments of 16 million mouse whole genome shotgun 
reads (3x coverage) vs. the draft human genome.</P>
<H2>Method</H2>
<P>The alignments were done 
with BLAT in translated protein mode requiring 7 out of 8 amino acids in a
row to match to trigger a detailed alignment.  The human
genome was masked with RepeatMasker and Tandem Repeat Finder before 
running BLAT.  Places where more than 400 reads aligned were filtered out.
Beware of alignments of greater than 97% identity.  These may reflect
mouse contamination of the human draft, or human contamination of the
mouse shotgun data.</P>

<P>This track is produced at UCSC. Mouse sequence data is provided by the 
Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium.
