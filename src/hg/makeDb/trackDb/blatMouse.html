<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track displays alignments of 16 million mouse whole genome shotgun 
reads (3x coverage) vs. the draft human genome.</P>
<H2>Method</H2>
<P>The alignments were done 
with <A HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656" TARGET=_blank>blat</A> 
in translated protein mode requiring 7 out of 8 amino acids in a
row to match to trigger a detailed alignment.  The human
genome was masked with 
<A HREF="http://www.repeatmasker.org" TARGET=_blank>RepeatMasker</A> 
and by <A HREF="http://tandem.biomath.mssm.edu/trf/trf.html" TARGET=_blank>Tandem Repeats Finder</A> before 
running blat.  Places where more than 400 reads aligned were filtered out.
Beware of alignments of greater than 97% identity.  These may reflect
mouse contamination of the human draft, or human contamination of the
mouse shotgun data.</P>
