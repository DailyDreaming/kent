<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
EST stands for Expressed Sequence Tags, a partial sequence of a randomly chosen cDNA, obtained from the results of a single DNA sequencing reaction. EST's are used both to identify transcribed regions in genomic sequence and to characterize patterns of gene expression in the tissue that was the source of the cDNA.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The annotation data file, RGD_EST.gff, is downloaded from 
<UL>
<LI>ftp://rgd.mcw.edu/pub/RGD_genome_annotations/V3.1/GFF_files/ 
</UL>
and processed to 
create two UCSC Genome Browser tables, rgdEst and rgdEstLink to enable this track.
<H2>Credits</H2>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://rgd.mcw.edu">RGD</a> (Rat Genome Database) for providing this annotation.  RGD is funded by grant HL64541 entitled "Rat Genome Database", awarded to Dr. Howard J Jacob, Medical College of Wisconsin from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (<a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov">NHLBI</a>) of the National Institutes of Health (<a href="http://www.nih.gov">NIH</a>).
