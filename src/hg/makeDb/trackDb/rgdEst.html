<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
An Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) is a partial sequence of a randomly-chosen cDNA, 
obtained from the results of a single DNA sequencing reaction. ESTs are used 
to identify transcribed regions in genomic sequence and to characterize patterns 
of gene expression in the tissue from which the cDNA was derived.

<H2>Methods</H2>

The annotation data file, RGD_EST.gff, was downloaded from 
<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<A HREF="ftp://rgd.mcw.edu/pub/RGD_genome_annotations/V3.1/GFF_files/" 
TARGET=_blank>ftp://rgd.mcw.edu/pub/RGD_genome_annotations/V3.1/GFF_files/</A> 
<br><br>
and processed to create two UCSC Genome Browser tables -- rgdEst and 
rgdEstLink -- to enable this track.
