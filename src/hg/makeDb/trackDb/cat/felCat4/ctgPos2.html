<P>
This track shows the whole genome shotgun (WGS) Scaffolds of the December 2008 
$organism assembly.
<P>
This assembly adds 0.9X coverage to the 1.9X coverage of cinnamon assembly (ANG00000000). 
The 0.9X coverage comes from six other breeds and one wild cat from paired-end fosmid ABI 3730 reads. 
All 2.8X coverage was assembled and mapped to the cat genome as described in the 1.9X cat genome publication.
