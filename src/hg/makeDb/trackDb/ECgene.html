<P>
<A HREF="http://genome.ewha.ac.kr/ECgene/" TARGET=_blank>ECgene</A> is a an EST 
clustering method that produces gene models based on 
genomic alignment of mRNA and ESTs. Exon alignments represented as a graph are
carefully analyzed to give all possible gene models, including splice variants. 
Compatible mRNA and ESTs for each gene model are clustered in a fashion similar
to that of UniGene.
