<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
<A HREF="http://genome.ewha.ac.kr/ECgene/" TARGET=_blank>ECgene</A> is a an EST 
clustering method that produces gene models based on 
genomic alignment of mRNA and ESTs. Exon alignments represented as a graph are
carefully analyzed to give all possible gene models, including splice variants. 
Compatible mRNA and ESTs for each gene model are clustered in a fashion similar
to that of UniGene. 
<P>
The following naming and display conventions are used for track features:
<UL>
<LI>mRNAs are denoted by an [m] following the accession number.
<LI>Read directions are denoted by [5] or [3] following an EST's accession number.
<LI>Presence of polyA or polyT is denoted by [A] or [T], respectively. 52% of 
trimest polyA marked as [A] or [T]. PolyA is determined by the genomic alignment 
of each sequence and the number of A's in that sequence.
<LI>ESTs from cDNA libraries associated with neoplasia are shown in gray as an 
aid in detecting cancer-related genes.
