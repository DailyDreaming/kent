<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.
<P>
There are 154,810 gaps of size 100 bases or more for a
total of 98,876,036 bases.  The largest gap, 3,000 bases,
occurs 1,043 times.  See also:

Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.

<P>All gaps in this assembly are unbridged fragment gaps:
<UL>
<LI><B>Fragment</B> - gaps between the Whole Genome Shotgun contigs of a 
supercontig.(In this context, a contig is a set of overlapping sequence reads.  
A supercontig is a set of contigs ordered and oriented during the 
Whole Genome Shotgun process using paired-end reads.)<BR>
These are represented by varying numbers of <em>N</em>s  in the assembly.  
Fragment gap sizes are usually taken from read pair data.
