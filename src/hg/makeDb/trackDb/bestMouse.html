<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>This track displays the best single alignment of each of the
mouse whole genome shotgun reads.  It was computed in the same
manner as the Blat Mouse track, but when a read aligned multiple
places all the alignments are displayed in that track, while
only the best alignment is displayed in this track.  On occassion
the alignment score may be equivalent in multiple places in which
case all equivalent 'best' alignments are displayed.</P>
<H2>Data Release Policy</H2>
These data are made available before scientific publication with the 
following understanding:<BR>
1.The data may be freely downloaded, used in analyses, and 
repackaged in databases.<BR>
2.Users are free to use the data in scientific papers analyzing 
particular genes and regions, provided that providers of this data 
(the Mouse Sequencing Consortium) are properly acknowledged.<BR>
3.The Centers producing the data reserve the right to publish the initial 
large-scale analyses of the dataset-including large-scale identification 
of regions of evolutionary conservation and large-scale 
genomic assembly. Large-scale refers to regions with size on the order of 
a chromosome (that is, 30 Mb or more). <BR>
4.Any redistribution of the data should carry this notice.<BR>
