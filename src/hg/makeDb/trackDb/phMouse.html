<P>PATTERNHUNTER is a highly sensitive and efficient program for
finding homologies within one, or between two DNA sequences.
On very long sequences it runs faster than MegaBlast while
being more sensitive than Blastn (at its default settings).</P>
<P>This track was produced by having PATTERNHUNTER index each human chromosome 
22 and processing all mouse reads in turn, looking
for double hits of weight 11 (using size 18 words with 7 don't cares in the
pattern 111010011001010111) to extend from and form gapped alignments.</P>
