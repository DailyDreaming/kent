<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows locations of Sequence Tagged Site (STS) markers
along the draft assembly.  These markers have been mapped using 
either genetic mapping (Genethon, Marshfield, and deCODE maps),
radiation hybridization mapping (Stanford, Whitehead RH, and GeneMap99 maps) or
YAC mapping (the Whitehead YAC map) techniques.  
Prior to August 2001, this track also
showed the approximate position of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) mapped clones.
In the August 2001 and later assemblies, the FISH clones are displayed in a separate track.</P>
<P>Genetic map markers are shown in blue; radiation hybrid map markers are shown 
in black. When a marker maps to multiple positions in the genome, it's shown in a 
lighter color.</P>

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>The track filter can be used to change the color or include/exclude a set of map data 
within the track. This is helpful when many items are shown in the track
display, especially when only some are relevant to the current task. To use the
filter:
<OL>
<LI>In the pulldown menu, select the map whose data you would like to highlight or exclude in the display. By default, the &quot;All Genetic&quot; option is selected.
<LI>Choose the color or display characteristic that will be used to highlight or
include/exclude the filtered items. If &quot;exclude&quot; is chosen, the browser will not
display data from the map selected in the pulldown list. If &quot;include&quot; is selected, the browser
will display only data from the selected map.
<LI>When you have finished configuring the filter, click the <em>Submit</em> button.
</OL></P>
