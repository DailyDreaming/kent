<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows the V3.0 (Aug. 2002) whole genome shotgun assembly of the Fugu rubripes genome, provided by the <A HREF=http://genome.jgi-psf.org/fugu6/fugu6.info.html>US DOE Joint Genome Institute</A>.
<p>
This assembly was constructed with the JGI assembler, JAZZ,
 paired end sequencing reads at a coverage of 5.7X produced at JGI, Myriad Genetics, and Celera Genomics.
 All reads are plasmid, cosmid, or BAC end-sequences, with the predominant coverage coming from 2 kb insert
 plasmids. The assembly contains 20,379 scaffolds totaling 319 million base pairs; the largest 679 scaffolds total
 160 million base pairs.
</P>
<P>The scaffolds in the display are ordered numerically, using the
scaffold numbering provided by JGI.  The UCSC browser depicts the Fugu genome as a single "unordered chromosome", with 1000 base pair "scaffold" gaps that are shown by the Gap track.  The scaffolds decrease in size as the scaffold number increases; scaffold #1 is the largest.
