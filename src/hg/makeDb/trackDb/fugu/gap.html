<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps between scaffolds that were added
to the assembly as part of the construction of the "unordered chromosome"
for this browser.  These gaps are listed as type "contig" and consist
of 1000 N's, and are "unbridged", since order and orientation between the
scaffolds is unknown.
</P><P>
At present, unknown bases within scaffolds are represented as N's,
however these are not shown in the gap track.
