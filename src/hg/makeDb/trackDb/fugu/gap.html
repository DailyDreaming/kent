<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly of chrUn, the &quot;unordered chromosome&quot;
for this browser.  Gaps are represented as black boxes.  If the relative order and 
orientation of the contigs on either side of the gap is known, 
it is a <em>bridged</em> gap. In this case, a white line is drawn through the 
black box representing the gap, and the gap label contains the word &quot;yes&quot;.

<P>There are 2 types of gaps in the Fugu assembly:
<UL>
<LI><B>Fragment</B> - gaps within a scaffold.
<LI><B>Contig</B> - gaps between scaffolds.  These gaps are placeholders of 1000 Ns
between scaffolds that were added as part of the construction of chrUn.  Because the
order and orientation between the scaffolds is unknown, contig gaps are considered to be
unbridged.
