<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps between scaffolds that were added
to the assembly as part of the construction of the &quot;unordered chromosome&quot;
for this browser.  These gaps are listed as type <em>contig</em> and consist
of 1000 N's. Because the order and orientation between 
the scaffolds is unknown, the gaps are considered to be unbridged.

<P>
In the current assembly, unknown bases within scaffolds are also represented 
by N's. However, these are not shown in the gap track.
