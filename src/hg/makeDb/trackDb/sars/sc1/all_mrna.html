<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows alignments between viral mRNAs
in GenBank and the SARS draft sequence. Aligning regions (usually exons)
are shown as black boxes connected by lines for gaps (spliced
out introns usually). In full display, arrows on the introns
indicate the direction of transcription.</P>

<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
GenBank viral mRNAs were aligned against the SARS draft sequence using the
blat program (translated alignments). 
These alignments are <b>not</b> filtered (as they usually would be 
for vertebrate genomes) because viruses evolve so quickly and there 
is much greater variance.  

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>
This track has a filter that can be used to change the display mode,
change the color, and include/exclude a subset of items within the track.
This may be helpful when many items are shown in the track display,
especially when only some are relevant to the current task.
The filter is located at the top of the track description page, which is
accessed via the small button to the left of the track's graphical
display or through the link on the track's control menu.
To use the filter:
<OL>
<LI>Type a term in one or more of the text boxes to filter the mRNA
display. For example, to apply the filter to all mRNAs expressed in the
liver, type &quot;liver&quot; in the tissue box. To view the list of
valid terms for each text box, consult the table in the Table Browser that
corresponds to the factor on which you wish to filter. For example, the
&quot;tissue&quot; table contains all the types of tissues that can be
entered into the tissue text box. Wildcards may also be used in the
filter.
<LI>If filtering on more than one value, choose the desired combination
logic. If &quot;and&quot; is selected, only mRNAs that match all filter
criteria will be highlighted. If &quot;or&quot; is selected, mRNAs that
match any one of the filter criteria will be highlighted.
<LI>Choose the color or display characteristic that should be used to
highlight or include/exclude the filtered items. If &quot;exclude&quot; is
chosen, the browser will not display mRNAs that match the filter criteria.
If &quot;include&quot; is selected, the browser will display only those
mRNAs that match the filter criteria.

<P>
This track is produced at UCSC from mRNA sequence data
submitted to the international public sequence databases by 
scientists worldwide.
