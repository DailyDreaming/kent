<H2> Description </H2>

This track shows the locations of the putative proteins annotated 
in Genbank as 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&db=Protein&term=NP_828849&doptcmdl=GenPept&tool=genome.ucsc.edu" TARGET=_BLANK>
NP_828849</A> (21-APR-2003, NP_828849.1  GI:29836505).  


<H2> Method </H2>

(From the Genbank entry):

<P>
Method: conceptual translation.
<P>
Note: It was assumed that the SARS orf1ab polyprotein processing map
should be similar to that of murine hepatitis virus. However, of the
two MHV papain-like proteinases, only PLP-2 seems to be well conserved
for SARS coronavirus. The putative mature peptides located downstream
from nsp1 are probably cleaved from the polyprotein by the nsp2
proteinase (3CL-PRO).  The preliminary annotation of
putative proteins and mature peptides was conducted at the NCBI.
<P>
Also note: There is a putative frameshift of -1 at genomic coord 13383 
(protein base 4379).
