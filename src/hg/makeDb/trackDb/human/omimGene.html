<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows a set of UCSC canonical genes that 
might be referenced by the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man 
(<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entck rez?db=omim">OMIM</A>)
database, based on cross-reference information from RefSeq and UniProt.
</P>

<P>OMIM is a compendium of human genes and genetic phenotypes. The full-text, 
referenced overviews in OMIM contain information on all known mendelian 
disorders and over 12,000 genes. OMIM is authored and edited at the 
McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University 
School of Medicine, under the direction of Dr. Ada Hamosh.  This database 
was initiated in the early 1960s by Dr. Victor A. McKusick as a catalog 
of mendelian traits and disorders, entitled Mendelian Inheritance
in Man (MIM). 
</P> 

<P><B>NOTE</B>: OMIM is intended for use primarily by physicians and other
professionals concerned with genetic disorders, by genetics researchers, and
by advanced students in science and medicine. While the OMIM database is
open to the public, users seeking information about a personal medical or
genetic condition are urged to consult with a qualified physician for
diagnosis and for answers to personal questions.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
We constructed this annotation as follows: 
<UL>
<LI>Compile a set of UCSC genes that have cross-references to RefSeq 
genes with OMIM IDs, as defined in the Genome Browser database refLink table. 
<LI>Compile a second set of UCSC genes in which the corresponding 
UniProt proteins have external links to MIM, based on data in the spXref2 table 
in the UCSC proteome database. 
<LI>Combine the two gene sets and remove duplicates, resulting in a subset of 
UCSC genes that have associated OMIM IDs.
<LI>Replace each of the genes in the combined set with its associated
canonical gene, based on data from the UCSC canonical gene set defined by 
the knownIsoforms and knownCanonical tables. 
<LI>Remove duplicates from the canonical set, sort the data and load it into 
the omimGene table.
</UL>
<P>
In addition, we loaded the data from the OMIM genemap file into the omimGeneMap 
table in the Genome Browser database. Descriptive information from
this table is displayed on the OMIM Related Genes details pages.
