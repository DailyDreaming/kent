<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows sequence annotation curated at the 
<A HREF="www.sanger.ac.uk" TARGET=_blank>Sanger Institute</A>.
<P>
Over 10% of the human genome, including two complete
chromosomes -- <A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/HGP/Chr20/" TARGET=_blank>20</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/HGP/Chr22/" TARGET=_blank>22<A> --
have been annotated by The Sequence
Annotation Team in collaboration with the individual 
<A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/HGP/Humana/" TARGET=_blank>Chromosome 
Project Teams</A>. 
<P>
NOTE: Sanger20 annotations appear only on chromosome 20.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Finished genomic sequence is analysed on a clone by clone basis using a
combination of similarity searches against DNA and protein databases as
well as a series of ab initio gene predictions (GENSCAN, FGENESH). Gene
structures are annotated on the basis of human interpretation of the
combined supportive evidence generated during sequence analysis. In
parallel, experimental methods are applied to extend incomplete
gene structures and discover new genes. The latter is initiated by
comparative analysis of the finished sequence with vertebrate datasets
such as the Riken mouse cDNAs, mouse whole-genome shotgun data and
GenescopeTetraodon Ecores.</P>
