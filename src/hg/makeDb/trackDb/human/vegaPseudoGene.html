main page:</P>
<P>
The 
<A HREF="http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/" TARGET=_BLANK>
Vertebrate Genome Annotation (VEGA)</A> 
database is designed to be a central repository for manual annotation
of different vertebrate finished genome sequence.
In collaboration with the genome sequencing centres Vega attempts to
present consistent high-quality curation of the published chromosome
sequences.</P>
<P>
Finished genomic sequence is analysed on a clone by clone basis using
a combination of similarity searches against DNA and protein databases
as well as a series of ab initio gene predictions (GENSCAN, Fgenes).</P>
<P>
In addition, comparative analysis using vertebrate datasets such as
the Riken mouse cDNAs and Genoscope <em>Tetraodon nigroviridis</em> Ecores
(Evolutionary Conserved Regions) are used for novel gene discovery.</P>
<P>
NOTE: VEGA annotations appear only on chromosomes 6, 7, 13,14, 20, and 22.
