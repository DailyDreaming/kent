Human RNA Editing<br>
<br>
Currently only A-to-I and C-to-U editing instances are in the data. 
Most edits are Adenosine in chromosome becomes Inosine in RNA via de-amination.
Rarely, Cytidine becomes Uridine via de-amination.<br>
<br>
Inosine is read as guanosine during translation.
A-to-I editing may alter codons,  
splice signals and RNA secondary structure.<br>
<br>
RNA editing locations are displayed as vertical dashes, which are colour coded as follows:<br> 
<span style="color: rgb(0,100,0)">5' UTR : Dark Green</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">CDS : Blue</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(255,0,0)">Intron : Red</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(255,20,147)">3' UTR : Deep Pink</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(0,0,0)">Other (exon/intron status is unclear or unknown) : Black</span><br>
