Human RNA Editing<br>
<br>
This track provides information on genomic coordinates corresponding to RNA nucleotides that are being edited after transcription. The track contains information on A-to-I and C-to-U RNA editing that occur due to deamination of adenosines and cytidines by ADAR and APOBEC enzymes, respectively. Most of the data are on A-to-I editing that is known to be highly abundant in humans.
<br>
<h2>Display</h2>
The coordinates corresponding to edited nucleotides are differentially colored depending on their occurrence within RNA transcripts:<br>
<span style="color: rgb(0,100,0)">5' UTR : Dark Green</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">CDS : Blue</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(255,0,0)">Intron : Red</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(255,20,147)">3' UTR : Deep Pink</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(0,0,0)">Other (exon/intron status is unclear or unknown) : Black</span><br>
<h2>Methods</h2>
The data were obtained from several research papers on RNA editing and were mapped to the reference genome. More detailed information (supporting EST, tissue sources, literature referenes, etc) can be obtained from <a href="http://darned.ucc.ie">DARNED</a> database.<br>
