<H2>Disclaimer</H2>
GAD is intended for use primarily by medical scientists 
and other professionals concerned with genetic disorders, 
by genetics researchers, and by advanced students in science 
and medicine. While GAD database is open to the public, 
users seeking information about a personal medical or 
genetic condition are urged to consult with a qualified 
physician for diagnosis and for answers to personal questions.
These data are provided by the Genetic Association Database
and do not represent any additional curation by UCSC.
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The <a href="http://geneticassociationdb.nih.gov/" TARGET=_BLANK>
Genetic Association Database</a> is an archive of human genetic 
association studies of complex diseases and disorders. The goal 
of the database is to allow the user to rapidly identify medically 
relevant polymorphism from the large volume of polymorphism and 
mutational data, in the context of standardized nomenclature.
</P>
<P>If the track is displayed in "pack" or "full" mode, mousing over an 
entry of this track will show a pop up message listing all associated 
diseases.  
If the track is displayed in "full" mode, a list of associated disease 
class codes (as defined below) will be shown on the left of the entry.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
<B>GAD:</B> Study data are recorded in the context of official human gene 
nomenclature with additional molecular reference numbers and links. It 
is gene-centered. That is, each record is a record of a gene or marker. 
If a study investigated 6 genes for a particular disorder, there will be 
6 records. Gene information is standardized, and annotated with molecular 
information, enabling integration with other molecular and genomic data 
resources.
</P>
<H2>Data</H2>
<P>

Data are added to GAD on a periodic
basis by the curator or by investigators. A majority of the records in GAD
are extracted from the online HuGE Navigator database, which is sponsored by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p>

HuGE Navigator
[<a href="http://www.hugenavigator.net/" target=_blank>www.hugenavigator.net</a>]
provides access to a continuously updated, curated knowledge base of
gene-disease associations, meta-analyses, and related information on genes
and diseases extracted from NCBI PubMed. A gene-centered view is available via
<a href="http://www.hugenavigator.net/HuGENavigator/startPagePedia.do" target=_blank>
Genopedia</a>, which is also available as
