<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
RACEfrags are the products of 5&#8217; RACE reactions performed on GENCODE genes (using the primers displayed in the subtrack "Gencode 5
&#8217; RACE primer") in 3 cell lines and 12 tissues (15 subtracks) followed by hybridization on ENCODE tiling arrays.
Each RACEfrag is linked to the 5&#8217; RACE primer but no other connectivity information is available from this experiment.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>

<P>
A combination of 5&#8217; RACE and 
high-density tiling microarrays were used to empirically annotate 5&#8217; 
transcription start sites (TSSs) and internal exons of all 410 annotated
protein-coding loci across the 44 ENCODE regions (Oct. 2005 GENCODE
freeze ; Harrow <em>et al</em>., 2006). The 5&#8217; RACE reactions were performed with oligonucleotides
mapping to a coding exon common to most of the transcripts of a protein-coding 
gene locus annotated by GENCODE (Oct. 2005 freeze) on polyA+ RNA
from twelve adult human tissues (brain, heart, kidney, spleen, liver,
colon, small intestine, muscle, lung, stomach, testis, placenta) and
three cell lines (GM06990, HL60 and HeLaS3).</P> 
<P>
The RACE reactions were then hybridized to 20 nucleotide-resolution
Affymetrix tiling arrays covering the non-repeated regions of the 44
ENCODE regions. The resulting &quot;RACEfrags&quot;
-- array-detected fragments of RACE products -- were assessed for
novelty by comparing their genome coordinates to those of
GENCODE-annotated exons. 


<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Connectivity between novel RACEfrags and their
respective index exon were investigated by RT-PCR, and hybridization on tiling arrays and cloning and
sequencing of the RT-PCR products (see more details in Denoeud <em>et al</em>., 2007). 385 RT-PCR reactions corresponding to 199 GENCODE loci were 
positive after hybridization on tiling arrays (244 RACE reactions), and 89 RT-PCR reactions (69 loci) were positive by cloning and sequencing.
The resulting cDNA sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers DQ655905-DQ656069 and EF070113-EF070122.
