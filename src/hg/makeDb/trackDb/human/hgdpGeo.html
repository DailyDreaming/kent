<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the 657,000 SNPs genotyped in 53 populations worldwide by the 
<A HREF="http://hagsc.org/hgdp/" TARGET=_BLANK>Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP)</A>.
This track and several others are available from the 
<A HREF="http://hgdp.uchicago.edu/" TARGET=_BLANK>HGDP Selection Browser</A>.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Samples were genotyped on an Illumina chip.  The observed alleles were
determined to be ancestral or derived by ???.
