<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The
<a target="_blank" href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/GTEx/index">NIH Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEX) project</a>
was designed to establish a sample and data resource for studies on the relationship between genetic variation 
and gene expression in multiple human tissues. 
This track shows median gene expression levels in 51 tissues and 2 cell lines, 
based on RNA-seq data from the GTEx midpoint milestone data release (V6, October 2015).
This release is based on data from 8555 tissue samples obtained from 570 adult post-mortem individuals.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<!-- Summarize Broad processing -->
<P>
Gene-level expression files from GTEx analysis, along with the gene model (GENCODE V19) and sample metadata
were downloaded from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gtexportal.org">GTEX portal</a>:
<a href="http://www.gtexportal.org/static/datasets/gtex_analysis_v6/rna_seq_data/GTEx_Analysis_v6_RNA-seq_RNA-SeQCv1.1.8_gene_rpkm.gct.gz">GTEx_Analysis_v6_RNA-seq_RNA-SeQCv1.1.8_gene_rpkm.gct</a>. Median expression level (in RPKM)  computed per gene/per tissue.  </P>

<H2>Subject and Sample Characteristics</H2>
<P>
The scientific goal of the GTEx project required that the donors and their biospecimen present with no evidence of disease. 
The tissue types collected were chosen based on their clinical significance, logistical feasibility and their 
relevance to the scientific goal of the project and the research community. 
Postmortem samples were collected from non-diseased donors with ages ranging from 20 to 79. 34.4% of donors were female and 65.6% male. 
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions</H2>
<P>
In Full and Pack display modes, each gene is represented by a gene model topped by a colored bar graph, 
where bar color indicates tissue and relative bar height the median expression level.  
The graph display has the same width and tissue order for all genes.
Mouse hover over the bars will show the tissue and median expression level, and
The gene model color indicates the transcript class, following GENCODE conventions.</P>
<P>
The track configuration page provides a filter to limit the tissues displayed, select between raw or log transformed display
of expression levels, and a mode to segment the samples by gender and display a difference graph.
</P>
Click-through on a graph displays a boxplot of expression level quartiles, per tissue, along with a link to the
appropriate gene page on the GTEX portal.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
Statistical analysis and data interpretation was performed by The GTEx Consortium Analysis Working Group. Data was provided by the Data Coordination Center at The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.</P>
