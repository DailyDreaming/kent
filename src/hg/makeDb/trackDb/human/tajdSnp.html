<H2>Description</H2>
<P>

This track shows the SNPs that were used in the calculation of Tajima's D (Tajima, 1989), a measure of nucleotide
diversity, estimated from the Perlegen data set (Hinds et al, 2005).
Tajima's D is a statistic used to compare an observed nucleotide
diversity against the expected diversity under the assumption that all
polymorphisms are selectively neutral and constant population size.

<H2>Methods</H2>

Please see the Tajima's D track or Carlson <I>et al.</I> for more details on the use of this track.

This track was created at the University of Washington using gfetch
from the Nickerson Laboratory and the R statistical software package
(<a href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</a>).
