<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows a 3-SNP moving average of heterozygosity on seven continents,
from SNPs genotyped in 53 populations worldwide by the 
<A HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/group/morrinst/hgdp.html" TARGET=_BLANK>Human 
Genome Diversity Project</A> in collaboration with the
<A HREF="http://www.cephb.fr/en/cephdb/" TARGET=_BLANK>Centre d'Etude 
du Polymorphisme Humain</A> (HGDP-CEPH).
This track and several others are available from the 
<A HREF="http://hgdp.uchicago.edu/" TARGET=_BLANK>HGDP Selection Browser</A>.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Samples collected by the HGDP-CEPH were genotyped for 657,000 SNPs at
<A HREF="http://hagsc.org/hgdp/" TARGET=_BLANK>Stanford</A>,
using Illumina BeadStation technology.  
The 53 populations were divided into seven continental groups: Africa,
Middle East, Europe, South Asia, East Asia, Oceania and the Americas.
For analysis (in Pickrell <em>et al.</em>), only the
Bantu populations in Africa were pooled instead of all African populations
because a more closely related group was desired for comparison with 
other continental groups.  Separate subtracks show the heterozygosity 
of all African populations and of Bantu populations.
Heterozygosity in each population group was computed for each SNP, and then a
3-SNP average was computed for each SNP and its two neighboring SNPs.
