<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The Denisova Seq track shows Denisova sequence reads mapped to the
human genome. The Denisova sequence was generated from a phalanx bone
excavated from Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains in southern
Siberia.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Denisova sequence libraries were prepared by treating DNA extracted
from a single phalanx bone with two enzymes: uracil-DNA-glycosylase,
which removes uracil residues from DNA to leave abasic sites, and
endonuclease VIII, which cuts DNA at the 59 and 39 sides of abasic
sites. Subsequent incubation with T4 polynucleotide kinase and T4 DNA
polymerase was used to generate phosphorylated blunt ends that are
amenable to adaptor ligation. Because the great majority of uracil
residues occur close to the ends of ancient DNA molecules, this
procedure leads to only a moderate reduction in average length of the
molecules in the library, but a several-fold reduction in
uracil-derived nucleotide misincorporation. Reads were aligned to hg18
using bwa.
