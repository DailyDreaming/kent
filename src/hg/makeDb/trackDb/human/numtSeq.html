<h2>Description and display conventions</h2> <p><b>NumtS</b> (Nuclear mitochondrial sequences) are
mitochondrial fragments inserted in nuclear genomic sequences. The most credited hypothesis
concerning their generation suggests that in the presence of mutagenic agents or under stress
conditions fragments of mtDNA escape from mitochondria, reach the nucleus and insert into
chromosomes during break repair, although NumtS can also be derived from duplication of genomic
fragments. NumtS may be the cause of contamination during human mtDNA sequencing and hence, frequent
false low heteroplasmic evidences have been reported. The Bioinformatics group chaired by M.
Attimonelli (Bari, Italy) has produced the RHNumtS compilation annotating more than 600 Human NumtS.
To allow the scientific community access to the compilation and to perform genomics comparative
analyses inclusive of the NumtS data, the group has designed the Human NumtS tracks below
described.</p>

<p>Tracks show the High Score Pairs (HSPs) obtained by aligning the mitochondrial reference genome
(NC_012920) with the hg18 release of the human genome.</p>

<ol> <li><b>"NumtS (Nuclear mitochondrial Sequences)" Track</b> <p> The "NumtS mitochondrial
sequences" track shows the mapping of the HSPs returned by BlastN on the nuclear genome. The shading
of the items reflects the similarity returned by BlastN, and the direction of the arrows is
concordant with the strand of the alignment. For every item, a link pointing to the mitochondrial
mapping is provided, thus allowing a fast cross among the NumtS genomic contexts.</p> </li>

<li><b>"NumtS assembled" Track</b> <p> The "NumtS assembled" track shows items obtained by
assembling HSPs annotated in the "NumtS" track fulfilling the following conditions: <ul type="disc">
<li> the orientation of their alignments must be concordant.</li> <li> the distance between them
must be less than 2 kb, on the mitochondrial genome as well as on the nuclear genome.</li> </ul> <p>
Exceptions for the second condition arise when a long repetitive element is present between two
HSPs.</p> </li>

<li><b>"NumtS on mitochondrion" Track</b> <p> The "NumtS on mitochondrion" track shows the mapping
of the HSPs on the mitochondrial genome. The shading of the items reflects the similarity returned
by BlastN, and the direction of the arrows is concordant with the strand of the alignment. For every
item, a link pointing to the nuclear mapping is provided.</p> </li>

<li><b>"NumtS on mitochondrion with chromosome placement" Track</b> <p>The "NumtS on mitochondrion
with chromosome placement" shows the mapping of the HSPs on the mitochondrial genome, but the items
are colored according to the colors assigned to each human chromosome on the UCSC genome browser. No
shading is provided here. For every item, a link pointing to the nuclear mapping is provided.</p>
</li> </ol>


<h2>Verification</h2> <p> NumtS predicted in silico were validated by carrying out PCR amplification
and sequencing on blood-extracted DNA of a healthy individual of European origin. PCR amplification
was successful for 155 NumtS and provided amplicons of the expected length. All PCR fragments were
sequenced on both strands.</p>

<h2>Credits</h2> <p> These data were provided by Domenico Simone and Marcella Attimonelli at
Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology "Ernesto Quagliariello" (University of Bari,
Italy). Primer designing was carried out by Francesco Calabrese and Giuseppe Mineccia. Validation
was carried out by Martin Lang, Domenico Simone and Giuseppe Gasparre.</p>
