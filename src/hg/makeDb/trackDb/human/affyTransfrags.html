<h2>Description.</h2>

<p>This track represents regions (transfrags) of chromosomes 6, 7, 13,
14, 19, 20, 21, 22, X, and Y that are thought to be transcribed based
on the transcriptome data from <a
href="http://www.affymetrix.com">Affymetrix</a>. This track is a
preview of the phase two Affymetrix transcriptome project and is based
on hybridzation of mRNA from the SK-N-AS cell line. Data from seven
additional cell lines will be available when the project is completed.

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>mRNA was isolated and hybridized to tiling GeneChips that contain a
probe ever 5bp over chromosomes 6, 7, 13, 14, 19, 20, 21, 22, X, and Y
(over 74 million probes total). The resulting data was normalized and
smoothed using the Hodges-Lehmann estimator associated with the
Wilcoxon signed rank statistic of the pm - mm values that lie within
+/- 30bp of a sliding window centered at every genomic coordinate. To
determine the locations of the transfrags the following method was
used:

<ul>
<li>A threshold of 13.93 (which gives an average FP rate of ~ 0.05 in negative bacterial controls)
<li>was applied to all the signal graphs and defined coordinates as positive.  Positive coordinates
<li>separated by gaps less than or equal to 30bp were merged.  Resulting regions that were less than
<li>50bp in length were filtered out.  Finally, 12bp were added to all start coordinates and 13bp to 
<li>all stop coordinates (ie. interbase coordinates) which shifts the coordinates to be centered over 
<li>probes as opposed to being left justified with respect to probes as is the case in the 
<li>raw and graph data.  
</ul>
