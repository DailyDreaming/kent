<H2>Description</H2>

<P>This track shows locations of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms
on the Affymetrix 120K SNP Genotyping Array.  The SNPs in this track
include all of the markers from the array that have been successfully
mapped against the current assembly.</P>

<P>The SNPs were selected from public domain databases or the Perlegen
SNP database. Genotypes for these markers were generated at Affymetrix
using GeneChip(r) DNA analysis technology.</P>

<P>During sample preparation, a restriction endonuclease is used to
fragment the genomic DNA into smaller pieces.  Either <I>HindIII</I>
or <I>XbaI</I> has been used for these data.</P>

<P>Genotypes are reported as pairs of basecalls representing the two
observed alleles.  Individual genotypes for which no call was made are
labeled 'NC'.</P>


<P><B>Allele Frequency</B> for the 'A' allele is two times the number of 'A'
calls plus the number of 'AB' calls, divided by the total number of
calls.  Allele Frequency for the 'B' allele is two times the number of
'B' calls plus the number of 'AB' calls, divided by the total number
of calls.  The <B>Minimum Allele Frequency</B> is the lesser of these two
values.</P>
