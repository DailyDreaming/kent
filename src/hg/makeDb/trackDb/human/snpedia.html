<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.snpedia.com">SNPedia</a> is a wiki investigating human
genetics with information about the effects of variations in DNA, citing
peer-reviewed scientific publications.

This track shows the genomic positions of all SNPedia entries with a 
text page that was created manually by a user and not a bot.
Clicks on the features show the text from the SNPedia page and a link to the original page.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
Genomic locations of SNPedia entries are labeled with the dbSNP ID.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
The mappings displayed in this track were used as provided in the SNPedia GFF file.
All SNPedia pages were downloaded and their content checked with a script that tries
to remove pages that were auto-generated and not created manually by a user.
</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>
Thanks to Mike Cariaso for help with the GFF download and Max Haeussler at UCSC for building this track.
