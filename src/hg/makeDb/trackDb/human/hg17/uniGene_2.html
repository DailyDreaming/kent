<P>
<B>S</B>erial <B>A</B>nalysis of <B>G</B>ene <B>E</B>xpression (SAGE)
is a quantitative measurement of gene expression. Data are presented for every 
cluster contained in the browser window and the selected cluster name is 
highlighted in red. All data are from the repository at the 
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SAGE/" TARGET=_blank>SageMap</a> project dated
August, 2004. Select the UniGene cluster name to display SageMap's page 
for that cluster.

<P>
SAGE counts are produced by sequencing small &quot;tags&quot; of DNA believed 
to be associated with a gene. These tags are produced by attaching poly-A RNA 
to oligo-dT beads. After synthesis of double stranded cDNA, transcripts are 
cleaved by an anchoring enzyme (usually NlaIII). Then small tags are 
produced by ligation with a linker containing a type IIS restriction 
enzyme site and cleavage with the tagging enzyme (usually BsmFI). The 
tags are then concatenated together and sequenced. The frequency of each 
tag is counted and used to infer expression level of transcripts that can 
be matched to that tag. All SAGE data presented here were mapped to UniGene 
transcripts by the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SAGE/" TARGET=_blank>SageMap</a>
project at <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" TARGET=_blank>NCBI</a>.
