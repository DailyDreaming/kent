<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the map of -log10(P-value) for ChIP-chip using Human
Hela S3 cells hybridized to maskless photolithographic arrays with 50-mer
oligonucleotides tiled with 12-nt overlaps covering most of the non-
repetitive DNA sequence of the ENCODE regions
This track shows the combined results of three multiple biological
replicates. For all arrays, the ChIP DNA was labeled with Cy5 and the
control DNA was labeled with Cy3.
These data are available at NCBI GEO, which also provides additional
information about the experimental protocols.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The data from replicates were quantile-normalized and median-scaled to each
other (both Cy3 and Cy5 channels). Using a 1000 bp sliding window centered
on each oligonucleotide probe, a signal map (estimating the fold enrichment
[log2 scale] of ChIP DNA) was generated by computing the pseudomedian
signal of all log2(Cy5/Cy3) ratios (median of pairwise averages) within the
window, including replicates. Using the same procedure, a -log10(P-value)
map (measuring significance of enrichment of oligonucleotide probes in the
window) for all sliding windows was made by computing P-values using the
Wilcoxon paired signed rank test comparing fluorensent intensity between
Cy5 and Cy3 for each oligonucleotide probe (Cy5 and Cy3 signals from the
same array). A binding site was determined by thresholding oligonucleotide
positions with -log10(P-value) (>= 4), extending qualified positions
upstream and downstream 250 bp, and requiring 1000 bp space between two
sites. Top 400 sites are retained.

<H2> Verification </H2>
<P>
ChIP-chip binding sites were verified by comparing "hit lists" generated
from combinations of different biological replicates. Only experiments that
yielded a significant overlap (greater than 50 percent) were accepted. As
an independent check (for maskless arrays), data on the microarray were
randomized with respect to position and re-scored; significantly fewer hits
(consistent with random noise) were generated this way.

These data were generated and analyzed by the labs of Michael Snyder, Mark
Gerstein and Sherman Weissman at Yale University.
