<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
In dense display mode, this track shows the coverage level of 
the genome.  Finished regions are depicted in black. Draft regions 
are shown in various shades of gray that correspond
to the level of coverage.  At high resolution these usually 
resolve into gaps between clones. 
</P><P>
In full display mode, this track shows the position of each 
clone that aligns to the genome sequence.  Where fragments of 
a clone do not form a continuous alignment, individual 
fragments are displayed against a gray background and 
numbered.  
</P>
<P>There are three levels in the Status field:
<UL>
<LI><B>Finished</B> - less than one error in 10,000 bases.
<LI><B>Draft</B> - more than 4x coverage.
<LI><B>Predraft</B> - less than 4x coverage.
</UL></P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>Clones from the National Center for Biotechnology Information 
(<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/build.html" 
TARGET = _BLANK>NCBI</A>) were aligned to the genome using 
<A HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/GR-1832Rv1" 
TARGET=_BLANK>psLayout</A>.  Where a clone 
record contained unordered fragments, fragments were individually 
aligned, then clustered about a median value and displayed together 
if they align with gaps no greater than 60 kb.  Some fragments in an 
original clone record may not be displayed.

<P>This track was devised by Jim Kent, with further engineering by
Hiram Clawson.
