<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays the results of Encode region-wide localisation for three transcription factors (HNF-3b, HNF-4a and USF-1) 
as well as for acetylation of Histone H3. The height of the peaks show the ratio of enriched non-amplified DNA compared to input DNA. 
<P>
The cut-off level used in the analysis is shown as a horizontal line in each subtrack. Tentative binding sites (TBS) in the spots passing the cut-off 
are visualised in a separate track, with binding sites numbered regarding the ranking of spots based on enrichment ratios. Each TBS are given a value 
indicating how often it was found in separate BioProspector runs (1000 = found in 10 out of 10 runs etc).  
<P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Chromatin IP was performed on HepG2 cells and hybridised to PCR-based tiling path arrays  as described in Rada-Iglesias et al. (2005). Removal of overlapping
sequences were done by changing the start position of downstream spots in order to generate a continuos track. To give each track a comparable scale, the value for the most enriched spots vere lowered to 15. Spots deemed as false positives when compared to a no-ab ChIP-chip experiment were given a value of 0.
<P>
<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Three replicates were performed. A negative control was done with a no antibody ChIP-chip to reduce the number of false positives. 
Semi-quantitative PCR was used to verify enrichment in at least ten positive spots for each antibody.

<P>
The experiments were done in the <A TARGET=_blank HREF="http://www.genpat.uu.se/Research/Research_Groups/">Claes Wadelius lab</A> and the statistical analysis was performed at the <A TARGET=_blank HREF="http://www.lcb.uu.se">Linneus center for Bioinformatics</A> at Uppsala University.
Microarrays were produced at the Sanger center.
