<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays the results of ENCODE region-wide localization for three 
transcription factors (HNF-3b, HNF-4a and USF-1) and acetylated 
histone H3 (H3ac). The heights of the peaks in the graphical display indicate 
the ratio of enriched non-amplified DNA to input DNA. </P>
<P>
The data for each of the transcription factors and H3ac are displayed in
individual subtracks. The analysis cut-off threshold is indicated in each 
subtrack by a horizontal line. Tentative binding sites (TBSs) 
in spots passing the cut-off are displayed in a separate subtrack, 
ChIP/Chip (HepG2) Sites. These sites are numbered corresponding to the ranking 
of spots based on enrichment ratios. Each TBS is assigned a value indicating 
how often it was found in separate BioProspector runs (<em>e.g.</em> 1000 
indicates that a TBS was found in ten out of ten runs).</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
ChIP was performed on HepG2 cells and hybridized to PCR-based tiling path 
arrays, as described in Rada-Iglesias <em>et al.</em> (2005). Overlapping
sequences were removed by changing the start position of downstream spots to 
generate a continuous track. To give each track a comparable scale, the values 
for the most enriched spots were lowered to 15. Spots deemed as false positives 
when compared to a no-ab ChIP/chip experiment were assigned a value of 0.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Three replicates were performed. A negative control was done with a no 
antibody ChIP/chip to reduce the number of false positives.  Semi-quantitative 
PCR was used to verify enrichment in at least ten positive spots for each 
antibody. </P>
