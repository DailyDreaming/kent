<P>
RFBRs are non-randomly distributed in the ENCODE regions with local enrichment and depletion. By mapping the full set of RFBRs onto the human genome sequence, we identified 583 genomic subregions with RFBR enrichment and 726 subregions with RFBR depletion (the RFBR ‘clusters’ and ‘deserts’, respectively) in the ENCODE regions.

The data set analyzed in this study is 105 lists of transcriptional regulatory elements in the ENCODE regions. It was released on December 13, 2005 by the Transcriptional Regulation Group. RFBR lists made available after this data freeze were not included in this study. 

The non-redundant factor-specific RFBR lists were mapped onto the ENCODE regions. Uninterrupted genomic regions that are covered by one or more RFBRs were identified as RFBR groups. Neighboring groups that are less than 1 kb apart are collected into RFBR clusters. Un-clustered groups that are covered by more than three RFBRs were promoted into clusters.

The data set was made available by the Transcriptional Regulation Group of the ENCODE Project Consortium. The RFBR cluster and desert tracks were generated by Zhengdong Zhang from Mark Gerstein’s group at Yale University.
