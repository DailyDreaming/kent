<!-- HTML Summary of UW DNase Array (GM06990) -->
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays DNaseI sensitivity/hypersensitivity (log[2] scale)
mapped over ENCODE regions in lymphoblastoid cells (GM06990) using the 
DNase/Array methodology (P.J.  Sabo et al., submitted for
publication).  DNaseI "hyperaccessibility" or "hypersensitivity" is a 
universal feature of active cis-regulatory sequences in vivo.  Peaks
in DNaseI sensitivity signal measured using DNase/Array represent
DNaseI hypersensitive sites. 

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
DNase/Array comprises a novel method for isolating DNA segments 
corresponding to specific DNaseI cleavage events on individual nuclear 
chromatin templates. Following purification, sample DNA is labeled and 
hybridized directly to a Nimblegen ENCODE genomic DNA tiling array, 
without amplification. DNaseI sensitivity signal is expressed as a 
log[2] ratio relative to a control sample comprising DNaseI-treated 
naked DNA.  The data are scaled so that log[2]=0 represents the 99% 
confidence bound on experimental noise; all values above the log[2]=0 
baseline are highly statistically significant. Signal peaks correspond 
with DNaseI hypersensitive sites. 


<H2>Validation</H2>
<P>
The data have been extensively validated by conventional DNaseI 
hypersensitivity assays (indirect end-label + Southern blotting
method).  The data have an overall sensitivity of 91.7%, and 
specificity of >99.5% for DNaseI hypersensitive sites.

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
The data were generated and validated by the UW ENCODE investigators
in collaboration with R. Green's group at Nimblegen, Inc. (Madison, WI).
