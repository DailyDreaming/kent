<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The FOX2 CLIPseq track shows adaptor-trimmed CLIPseq reads that mapped
uniquely to the repeat-masked human genome.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Cross-linking immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput
sequencing (CLIP-seq) of cell type-specific splicing regulator FOX2
(also known as RBM9) was performed in human embryonic stem cells.
MosaikAligner was utilized to align the reads to the repeat-masked
genome.
