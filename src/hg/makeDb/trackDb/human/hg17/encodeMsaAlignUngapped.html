<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays the number of ungapped species for every human base 
in the multiple-sequence alignments in ENCODE regions in the Sep 2005 
ENCODE MSA freeze, which were generated by the programs MAVID, 
MLAGAN and TBA (v2).

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The number of ungapped species for every human base in every alignment 
is displayed. 
This track complements the Alignment Agreement track (Align Agree), 
and is useful for 
distinguishing between agreement on gaps versus agreement on matched bases.

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
The agreement tracks were generated by 
<a href="http://math.berkeley.edu/~lpachter/">Lior Pachter</a>
and <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~sariel/">Ariel Schwartz</a>
of UC Berkeley.<br>
