<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track consolidates variants from locus specific databases
into a single track.  It currently has entries from the HbVar database.

<H2>Variant Sources</H2>
<UL>
<LI>
The <B>HbVar</B> database has variants found in the globin loci.  
The database can be found at 
<a href="http://www.bx.psu.edu/" target="_blank">http://www.bx.psu.edu/</a>.
<LI>
Coming soon, CFTR data.
Currently a few sample variants from this region have been added.
<LI>
Possible connection with WayStation. HGVS community-wide database.

<H2>Filtering</H2>
<UL>
<LI>
Filtering can be done on the location of the mutation.  This is the location
with respect to genes, eg. exclude exons, introns, 5' utr, 3' utr or 
not within known transcription unit.
<LI>
Filtering can also be done by excluding types of the mutations.  The types are
substitution, insertion, deletion, duplication, and complex.

<H2>Supporting Details</H2>
<P> 
Positional information can be found in the annotations section
of the Genome Browser 
<A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html">downloads</A> page, 
which is organized by species and assembly. Non-positional information
can be found in the 
<A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hgFixed/database/">shared
data</A> section of the same page.
