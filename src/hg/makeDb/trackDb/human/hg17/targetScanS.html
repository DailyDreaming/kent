<P>
MicroRNA regulatory targets predicted by TargetScanS.  This track 
displays conserved mammalian microRNA target sites in the 3'-UTR
regions of Refseq Genes.  

<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
Putative miRNA binding sites on mRNAs were identified using 6-nucleotide 
seed sequences from all known miRNAs conserved among human, mouse, rat, 
dog and chicken.  These seed sequences were probed against the 3'-end 
of conserved mRNAs from the five genomes.
