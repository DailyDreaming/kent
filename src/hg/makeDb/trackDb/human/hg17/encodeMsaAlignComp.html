<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays the agreement level between multiple-sequence alignments 
in ENCODE regions in the Sep 2005 ENCODE MSA freeze, which were generated by the programs MAVID, MLAGAN and TBA (v2).
The agreement between every pair of alignments on a base by base resolution is displayed, as well as the overall mean
agreement between all three alignment pairs.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The agreement for a given human base, is computed as the
fraction of species other than human on which the two alignments
exactly agree. Note that two alignments can agree by aligning
the human to the same base in another species, or by both aligning
the human base to a gap.
<p> 
Note that when a human base is completely gapped by two programs
there is perfect agreement. This is in a sense, a bit misleading, as
the agreement in the alignment may simply be an artifact of missing
sequence in the other species. So we also provide tracks showing the
number of ungapped species for every base in every alignment (Align Gaps).
