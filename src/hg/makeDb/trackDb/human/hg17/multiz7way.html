<H2>Description</H2> <P>
This track shows a measure of evolutionary conservation in human, chimp, 
mouse, rat, chicken, fugu, and zebrafish, 
based on a phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phastCons).
Multiz alignments of the following assemblies were used to generate this
annotation: 
human May 2004 (hg17), 
chimp Nov. 2003 (panTro1),
mouse Oct. 2003 (mm4), 
rat Jun. 2003 (rn3), 
chicken Feb. 2004 (galGal2),
fugu Aug. 2002 (fr1),
and zebrafish Nov. 2003 (danRer1).</P>
<P>
In full display mode, this track shows the overall conservation score across all
species as well as pairwise alignments 
of each species aligned to the 
human genome.  The pairwise alignments are
shown in dense display mode using a grayscale 
density gradient.  The checkboxes in the track configuration section allow
the exclusion of species from the pairwise display; however, this does not
remove them from the conservation score display.  </P>
<P>
When zoomed-in to the base-display level, the track shows the base 
composition of each alignment. The numbers and symbols on the &quot;human 
gap&quot; line indicate the lengths of gaps in the human sequence at those 
alignment positions. If the gap size is greater than 9, a symbol indicates this; a &quot;*&quot is displayed if the gap size is multiple of 3, otherwise a &quot;*&quot; is displayed.
To view detailed information about the 
alignments at a specific position, zoom in the display to 30,000 or fewer bases, 
then click on the alignment.  </P>
<P>
This track may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects 
of the displayed information. Click the &quot;Graph configuration help&quot; link
for an explanation of the configuration options.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P> 
Best-in-genome blastz pairwise alignments 
were multiply aligned using multiz, beginning with human-chimp alignments
and subsequently adding in mouse, rat, chicken, fugu, and zebrafish.
The resulting multiple alignments were then assigned 
conservation scores by phastCons.</P>
<P>
The phastCons program computes conservation scores based on a phylo-HMM, a
type of probabilistic model that describes both the process of DNA substitution at
each site in a genome and the way this process changes from one site to the
next (Felsenstein and Churchill 1996, Yang 1995, Siepel and Haussler 2003,
Siepel and Haussler 2004). In this case, a two-state phylo-HMM was used,
with a state for conserved regions and a state for non-conserved regions.
The value plotted at each site is the posterior probability that the
corresponding alignment column was "generated" by the conserved state of
the phylo-HMM.  These scores reflect the phylogeny (including branch
lengths) of the species in question, a continuous-time Markov model of the
nucleotide substitution process, and a tendency for conservation levels to
be autocorrelated along the genome (i.e., to be similar at adjacent sites).  The
general reversible (REV) substitution model was used, and variation of
substitution rates within each major category of sites (conserved and
non-conserved) was allowed for using Yang's (1994) discrete gamma model.
Note that, unlike many conservation-scoring programs, phastCons does not
rely on a sliding window of fixed size, so short highly-conserved regions
and long moderately conserved regions can both obtain high scores.</P>
<P> 
PhastCons currently treats alignment gaps as missing data, which
sometimes has the effect of producing undesirably high conservation scores
in gappy regions of the alignment.  We are looking at several possible ways
of improving the handling of alignment gaps.</P>
