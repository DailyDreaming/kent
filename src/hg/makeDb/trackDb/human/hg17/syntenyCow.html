This track depicts human-cattle synteny segments as defined on the basis                                                 of a cattle-human comparative map containing 3,204 BAC-end sequences and                                                 EST markers with a single significant hit (E-value less than 0.0001) in the human                                        genome sequence (hg15) as defined by the TimeLogic Tera-BLASTn program                                                   (Everts van der Wind et al. 2005, PNAS 102:18526-18531). The synteny                                                     blocks were defined according to the rules described in Murphy et al.                                                    2005, Science 309: 613-617.
