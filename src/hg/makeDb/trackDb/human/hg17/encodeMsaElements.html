<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The consensus elements in this track were generated from the nine different 
combinations of three conservation algorithms (phastCons, binCons, and GERP) 
and three sequence alignment methods (TBA,MLAGAN and MAVID) applied to
the ENCODE region sequences of 27 vertebrates as defined in the
October 2005 ENCODE sequence freeze.
<P>
Three different stringencies were used. 
The <em>loose</em> set of constrained 
sequences represent bases identified as being constrained by any 
conservation algorithm on any alignment. The <em>moderate</em> set of 
constrained sequences is derived from bases shown to be constrained by
at least two of the three conservation algorithms, on at least two of 
the three alignments. And finally the <em>strict</em> set of constrained 
sequences represent only those bases that were constrained using all 
three conservation programs on all three multi-sequence alignments.
