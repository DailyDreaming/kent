<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows putative binding loci of c-myc as determined 
by STAGE (Sequence Tag Analysis of Genomic Enrichment). 
The c-myc (cellular myelocytomatosis) protein is a transcription 
factor associated with cell proliferation, diffentiation, and
neoplastic disease.
<P>
STAGE was performed in HeLa cells under normal growth conditions
(10% Fetal Bovine Serum) using anti-myc antibody. 
Cloned STAGE tags were sequenced and mapped to the human genome as described in Kim <i>et al</i> Nature Methods 2005, referenced below.
<P>
The Tags subtrack shows all STAGE tags within the ENCODE region and thus 
represent the raw data. 
The Peaks subtrack shows high confidence c-myc binding  
regions derived from the STAGE tags.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Repeat masker was applied at low stringency (score more than 1500) 
to exclude tags within repeat regions. 
<P>
Each tag was assigned a probability of enrichment that was calculated 
from the frequency of occurrence of the tag in the 
STAGE sequencing pool and the number of times the tag is present in 
the genome, assuming a binomial distribution. 
Tags having genomic frequency of more than 10 were discarded. 
In general, a low STAGE pool frequency with a high genomic
frequency generates a score close to 1, indicating
a very low probability of enrichment.  For purposes of 
visualization, these tags were assigned an artificially
inflated score of 300, however for analysis, a score of 1 should be used.
<P>
Peaks were determined by using a 500 bp window to scan across each chromosome. 
Each window was assigned a probability based on the tags mapped 
within that window. 

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Scores generated from the real data were cmopared to
simulations where similar numbers of tags were randomly sampled from the genome.
Calculating probabilities as above, a probability cut-off of 0.8 gave a false positive rate of less than 0.05.
