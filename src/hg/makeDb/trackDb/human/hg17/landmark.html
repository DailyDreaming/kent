<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Consolidates regulatory regions and other useful landmarks that
are not included in other tracks.  The landmarks come from 
locus-specific databases and locus experts.
This prototype version includes entries mostly from the alpha and beta globin 
loci, plus a few entries from other regions.

<H2>Data Filtering</H2>
<UL>
<LI>
Filtering can be performed on the type of the region.  
Types include regulatory, promoter, enhancer, and hypersensitive site.
