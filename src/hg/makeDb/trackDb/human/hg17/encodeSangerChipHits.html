Hits for the Sanger PCR array ChIP-chip platform


<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Hits are found using an HMM analysis which produces 
both "hit regions" and the peak centers.

The submitted tracks contain the ChIP-chip data, the hit regions, and
the hit centers.  We recommend that others wanting the hits take the peak
centers and expand them to whatever size your analysis uses.

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
The data is generated by Ian Dunham's lab at the Sanger
Insitute.  Contacts: Ian Dunham (id1@sanger.ac.uk) and Christoph Kock (cmk@sanger.ac.uk).

The HMM analysis is done at the EBI by (flicek@ebi.ac.uk).
