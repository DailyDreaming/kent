<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows the genomic positions of all SNPedia entries with a 
text page that is not auto-generated by the SNPedia pipeline.
Clicks on the features show the text from the SNPedia page.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
Genomic locations of SNPedia entries are labeled with the dbSNP ID.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
The mappings displayed in this track were used as provided on the SNPedia GFF file.
All SNPedia pages were downloaded and their content checked with a script that tries
to remove pages that were auto-generated and not created manually by a user.
</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>
Thanks to Mike Cariaso for help with the GFF download and Max Haeussler at UCSC for building this track.
