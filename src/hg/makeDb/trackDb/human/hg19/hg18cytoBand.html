<P>
This track shows the locations of hg18 cytoBands simply mapped 
directly onto hg19 - not lifted.  the relative sizes of the bands
can be seen to be different from hg19 cytoBands in certain places,
especially on chr3, 6, 7, 11, 16 and mostly chr19.  this is in part
due to the nature of the new hg19 assembly process which includes
Celera contigs for the first time.
