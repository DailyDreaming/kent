<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In humans, every messenger RNA (mRNA) undergoes extensive processing
by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). These RBPs regulate both the
forms and abundances of mRNAs in the cell through processes including
pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA export and localization, and mRNA decay.
Most analyses of genomic regulation have focused on gene expression,
but arguably one cannot understand the consequences of gene expression
without understanding how the expressed pre-mRNAs and mRNAs are
processed.<br>
</p>
<p>RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP, also known as CLIP) can elucidate RNA
processing by identifying RNA molecules that interact with specific
RBPs. This method is similar to ChIP. First, cells are
exposed to a reagent such as formaldehyde to establish cross-links
between RNA and RBPs. Then, the cells are lysed, and an antibody
is used to select complexes containing the RBP of interest. The
RNAs and RBPs are then separated by reverse cross-linking, and the RNAs
are then identified via sequencing (RIP-seq) or microarray analysis
(RIP-chip). <br>
</p>
<p>The tracks of this supertrack include two types of
information. When the purified RNA is analyzed with a gene
expression array, the output identifies genes whose transcripts were
bound by the given RBPs. Examples of this include SUNY GeneST and
SUNY Switchgear. Alternatively, when the purified RNA is
sequenced or is analyzed with a tiling array, the output also
identifies the location where the RBP bound the pre-mRNA
transcripts. Examples of this include SUNY RIP Tiling and SUNY
RIP -seq.<br>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
These tracks are multi-view composite tracks that contains multiple
data types (views). Each view within each track
has separate display controls, as described <a
 href="http://hgwdev.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/multiView.html">here</a>.
Most
ENCODE tracks contain multiple subtracks, corresponding to
multiple experimental conditions. If a track contains a large
number of subtracks, only some subtracks will be displayed by default.
The user can select which subtracks are displayed via the display
controls
on the track details pages.</p>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>
These data were generated and analyzed as part of the <a
 href="http://www.genome.gov/10005107">ENCODE</a> project, a
genome-wide consortium project with the aim of cataloging all
functional elements in the human genome. This effort includes
collecting a variety of data across related experimental conditions, to
facilitate integrative analysis. Consequently, additional ENCODE tracks
may contain data that is relevant to the data in these tracks.</p>

<h2>Data Release Policy</h2>
<p>
Data users may freely use ENCODE data, but may not, without prior
consent, submit publications that use an unpublished ENCODE dataset
until nine months following the release of the dataset. This date is
listed in the Restricted Until column on the track configuration page
and the download page. The full data release policy for ENCODE is
