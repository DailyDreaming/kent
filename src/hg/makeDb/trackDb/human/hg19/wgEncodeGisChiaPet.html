Description

This track is produced as part of the ENCODE Chromatin Interaction Analysis with Paired-End
Tag (ChIA-PET) Project. It shows the locations of oestrogen receptor .-bound (ER-.-bound)
chromatin interactions determined by Paired-End Tag (PET) sequencing using proximity-ligated
chromatin extracts from the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. A chromatin interaction is
defined as two regions of the genome that are far apart in terms of genomic distance, but are
spatially proximate to each other in the 3-dimensional cellular nucleus.

Additionally, the ER-. ChIA-PET experiment generates oestrogen receptor . binding sites. A
binding site is defined as a region of the genome that is highly enriched by specific Chromatin
ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) against a transcription factor, which indicates that the transcription
factor binds specifically to this region. Generally, a chromatin interaction is more likely to
connect two oestrogen receptor . binding sites together.

In the graphical display, the tags (ends) are represented by blocks, and connected by a horizontal
line if both ends are in the same chromosome and in a viewable window. PET sequences that
overlap at both ends form PET clusters and the total count of PETs in a PET cluster reflects
the strength of a chromatin interaction. Singleton PETs (PET count = 1 in a PET cluster) are
most likely noise, whereas PET clusters with PET count 3 and above could indicate genuine
chromatin interactions. A density track of the tags shows the ChIP enrichment at different points
of genome, and high peaks indicate oestrogen receptor . binding sites.

Methods

Recently, we developed Chromatin Interaction Analysis with Paired-End Tag (ChIA-PET)
Sequencing, a global, de novo, high-throughput method for characterizing the 3-dimensional
structure of chromatins in the nucleus. In the ChIA-PET protocol, cells were cross-linked,
fragmented, and chromatin immunoprecipitated. The DNA fragments which are brought close
together by the chromatin interactions were then proximity-ligated. During this proximity
ligation step, the half-linkers containing flanking MmeI sites (type IIS restriction enzymes) were
first ligated to the DNA fragments; then, the half-linkers were ligated to each other to form full
linkers. Full linkers bridge either two ends of a self-circularized fragment, or two ends of two
different chromatin fragments. The material was then reverse cross-linked, purified, and digested
with MmeI. As MmeI cuts 20 base pairs away from its recognition site, tag-linker-tag (Paired-
End Tag, .PET.) constructs were obtained, which was then sequenced by ultra-high-throughput
methods (454 pyrosequencing and Illumina paired end sequencing).

Verification

For the validation, 14 experimental sites were tested, and 3 negative controls. 12 of 14
experimental sites were validated - the 2 experimental sites which could not be validated had
unreproducible interchromosomal interactions. All 3 negative control sites were validated.
We used a variety of methods, including FISH, ChIP-3C, 3C, and 4C, to do the validation.
An additional 3 sites were also shown to have chromatin interactions by other papers. The
successful experimental sites we tested were: TFF1 (3C, ChIP-3C), GREB1 (3C, ChIP-3C),
P2RY2 (3C, ChIP-3C), SIAH2 (3C, ChIP-3C), Keratin cluster (4C), NR2F2 (FISH), GATA3

(FISH), BX647900 (ChIP-3C), CAP2 (ChIP-3C), ELOVL2 (ChIP-3C), SLC9A3R1 (ChIP-3C),
and DB554846 (ChIP-3C). The unsuccessful experimental sites were: chr7:2692293-2698011 to
chr12:120670670-120673138, and chr9:113812545-113817679 to chr14:90811137-90814459.
The negative control sites, which all worked, were: NOTCH2, GREB1 (chr2) to TFF1 (chr21),
and P2RY2 (chr11) to GREB1 (chr2).Validation was performed by FISH, 3C, ChIP-3C and 4C
analyses on selected sites.
