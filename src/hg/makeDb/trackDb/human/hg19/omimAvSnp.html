<H2>Description</H2>

<TABLE BORDER = 1 CELLPADDING = 4><TR><TD>
<P><FONT COLOR = RED><B>NOTE</FONT>: OMIM is intended for use
 primarily by physicians and other
professionals concerned with genetic disorders, by genetics researchers, and
by advanced students in science and medicine. While the OMIM database is
open to the public, users seeking information about a personal medical or
genetic condition are urged to consult with a qualified physician for
diagnosis and for answers to personal questions.
</P>
<P>Because the UCSC Genes mappings are based on associations from RefSeq and
UniProt, they are dependent on any interpretations from those sources.
Furthermore, because many OMIM records refer to multiple gene names,
or syndromes not tightly mapped to individual genes, the associations
in this track should be treated with skepticism and any conclusions
based on them should be carefully scrutinized using independent
resources. </B>

<P>
This track shows the 	
OMIM Allelic Variant SNPs 
in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(<A HREF="http://www.omim.org/"
TARGET=_blank>OMIM</A>) database.
</P>

<P>OMIM is a compendium of human genes and genetic phenotypes. The full-text, 
referenced overviews in OMIM contain information on all known Mendelian 
disorders and over 12,000 genes. OMIM is authored and edited at the 
McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University 
School of Medicine, under the direction of Dr. Ada Hamosh.  This database 
was initiated in the early 1960s by Dr. Victor A. McKusick as a catalog 
of Mendelian traits and disorders, entitled Mendelian Inheritance
in Man (MIM). 
</P> 
<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>Genomic positions of OMIM Allelic Variant SNPs are marked by solid
blocks.  
<P> The amino acid replacement, DbSNP ID, and allelic variant description are displayed on the details page for each variant. 
</P>

<P>On the main browser display, the description of the OMIM entry are shown when Full display mode is chosen.  In Pack mode, the entry description is shown when mousing over each entries.
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
This track was constructed as follows: 
<UL>
<LI>The OMIM allelic variant data file, <TT>mimAV.txt</TT>, is obtained from OMIM and loaded into an MySQL table <TT>omimAv</TT>.
<LI>The genomic positions of indvidual allelic variant SNPs are obtained from the <TT>snp132</TT> table and compiled into a bed file and then loaded into the <TT>omimAvSnp</TT> table.
</UL>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
Thanks to OMIM and NCBI for the use of their data. This track was
constructed by Fan Hsu in the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group.</P>
