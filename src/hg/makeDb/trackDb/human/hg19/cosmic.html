<h2>Description</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/">COSMIC</a>, the "Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In 
Cancer" is an online database of somatic mutations found in human cancer. Focused exclusively on
non-inherited acquired mutations, COSMIC combines information from a range of sources, curating the
described relationships between cancer phenotypes and gene (& genomic) mutations. This data is then
made available in a number of ways including here in the UCSC genome browser, on the COSMIC website
with custom analytical tools, via a federated <a
href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/biomart/martview/">Biomart</a>, or offline via
datasheets downloaded from the <a href="ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/CGP/cosmic">FTP site</a>.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The data in COSMIC is curated from a number of high-quality sources and combined into a single
resource. The sources include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Peer-reviewed journal articles
<li><a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/cancergenome/">CGP laboratories at the Sanger
Institute, UK</a>
<li><a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">TCGA data portal</a>
<li><a href="http://dcc.icgc.org/">The ICGC data portal</a>
<li><a href="http://www-p53.iarc.fr/">IARC p53 database</a>
</ul>

<p>Information on known cancer genes, selected from the <a
href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/Census/">Cancer Gene Census</a> is curated manually to
maximise its descriptive content. Data from large scale systematic screens are curated 
semi-automatically, using Vagrent software to reannotate mutant genomic positions (version 0.1 is 
described at <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/vagrent/">VAGrENT: Variation 
Annotation Generator</a>). The full curated dataset is exported from the COSMIC database in CSV 
format for uploading to UCSC for each bimonthly release, and this file is also available on the FTP 
site.</p>

<h2>Display</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dense - Indicate the positions where COSMIC mutations have been annotated in a single horizontal
track
<li>Squish - Indicate each mutation, in vertical pileups where appropriate.
					whilst minimising screen space used.
<li>Pack - Indicate each mutation with COSMIC identifier (COSMnnnnn), providing links to further
details.
<li>Full - Show each mutation in detail, one per line, with COSM identifier, mutation annotation,
overall mutation frequency and tissues affected, with a link to even further details.
</ul>
