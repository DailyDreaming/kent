<H2> Description </H2>
<P>This track displays copy number variation (CNV) as determined by the Illumina Human 1M-Duo Infinium HD BeadChip assay and circular binary segmentation (CBS).  The Human 1M-Duo contains more than 1,100,000 tagSNP markers and a set of &#126;60,000 additional CNV-targeted markers.  The median spacing between markers is 1.5 kb and the mean spacing is 2.4 kb.  The B-allele frequency and genotyping single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data generated by the experiment are not displayed, but are available for download from the Downloads page.  
</P>

<P>Where applicable, biological replicates of each cell line are reported separately.  Possible uses of the data include correction of copy number in peak-calling for ChIP-seq, transcriptome, DNase hypersensitivity, and methylation determinations.
</P>

<H3> Track Conventions</H3>

<P> The track displays regions of the genome where copy number variation has been assessed.  CNV regions are colored by type: </P>

<UL>
<LI> magenta  = amplified 
<LI> green  = homozygous deletion
<LI> blue  = heterozygous deletion 
<LI> black = normal
</UL>

<P> The mean log R ratio for each region can be seen by clicking on each individual region. See Methods below for significance of log R ratio values.   The mean log R ratio for each region is reported in the .bed file available for download.
</P>
<P>The Illumina 1M-Duo B-allele frequency data is available for download.  This file (HAIB_1MDuo_B-allele.txt) was generated using the standard Illumina protocol and contains the B-allele frequency for all cell types tested.  The genotype calls for all cell types tested are also available for download (HAIB_1MDuo_Genotypes.txt).  Genotyping calls with a Gencall value greater than 0.6 are considered significant.  
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<H3> Isolation of genomic DNA and hybridization</H3>
<P> Cells were grown according to the approved
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/cellTypes.html"> ENCODE cell culture protocols</A> by the Myers lab and by other ENCODE production groups.  The production group is reported in the metadata.  Genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen).  DNA concentration and quality were determined by fluorescence, and 400 nanograms of each sample were hybridized to Illumina 1M-Duo DNA Analysis BeadChips.
</P>

<H2> Processing and Analysis </H3>
<P>We ascertained the genotypes from the 1M-Duo Arrays with BeadStudio by using default settings and formatting with the A/B genotype designation for each SNP.  Primary QC for each sample was a cut-off at a call rate of 0.95.
</P>

<P> We performed Copy Number Variation (CNV) analysis with circular binary segmentation (DNAcopy) of the log R ratio values at each probe (Olshen et al., 2004).  The parameters used were alpha=0.001, nperm=5000, sd.undo=1.  The copy number segments are reported with the mean log R ratio for each chromosomal segment called by CBS.  Log ratios of &#126;-0.2 to -1.5 can be considered heterozygous deletions, < -1.5 homozygous deletions, and &#62; 0.2 amplifications. Primary QC for each sample was SD(logR) of &#60; 0.6.
</P>

<P>This is the NCBI Build37 (hg19) release of this track.  This release includes the 3 cell types previously released on NCBI Build36 (hg18) and adds data for many more cell types.  The track includes a single display for each cell type and reports the Log ratio in the .bed files.  The B-allele frequency and SNP genotyping files are not displayed, but are available for download for the entire dataset.
