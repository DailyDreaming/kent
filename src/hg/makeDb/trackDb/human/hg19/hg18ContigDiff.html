<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track indicates differences in this human genome assembly,
(GRCh37/hg19), from the previous version, NCBI Build 36(hg18).
Contigs used in the assembly of GRCh37(hg19) that were not
present in NCBI Build 36(hg18) are shown.
</P>
<P>
Differences can be attributed to:
<UL>
<LI>New contigs added to this assembly to fill in missing sequence
<LI>Updated versions of the same contig to correct errors in the sequence
<LI>Different portions of the same contig used in this assembly compared to the previous assembly
</UL>
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The contig coordinates were extracted from the AGP files for the assemblies.
Contigs that match the same name, same version, and the identical specific
portion of sequence from the contig are noted as identical in the two
assemblies.  Contigs not satisifying those identical characteristics are
included in this track.
