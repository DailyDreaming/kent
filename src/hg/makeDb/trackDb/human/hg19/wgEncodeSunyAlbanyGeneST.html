<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track is produced as part of the ENCODE Project.
This track displays transcriptional fragments associated with RNA binding proteins in different
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=cellType">cell lines</A>,
using RIP-Chip(Ribonomic) profiling on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
The <i>RBP Assoc RNA</i> view shows the genomic location of transcripts
associated with the array probes.
Data for this track was produced as part of the
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/ENCODE/index.html">
Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project</A>,

</P>


<P>In eukaryotic organisms gene regulatory networks require an additional
level of coordination that links transcriptional and post-transcriptional
processes. Messenger RNAs have traditionally been viewed as passive
molecules in the pathway from transcription to translation. However,
it is now clear that RNA-binding proteins play a major role in
regulating multiple mRNAs in order to facilitate gene expression patterns.
These tracks show the associated mRNAs that co-precipitate with the
targeted RNA-binding proteins using RIP-Chip profiling.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>This track is a multi-view composite track. For each view there
are multiple subtracks that display individually in the browser.
The subtracks within this track correspond to different antibodies/target
proteins tested in different cell lines.
This track is initially released with a single view:

<DL>
<DT><i>RBP Assoc RNA</i>
<DD>The RBP Assoc RNA view shows the genomic extent of the transcripts
associated with the Affymetrix Gene Array probes.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>RBP-mRNA complexes were purified from cells grown according to the approved
<A HREF="../../ENCODE/protocols/cell">ENCODE cell culture protocols </A>.
The associated transcripts were identified using GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
Arrays were analyzed using Agilent's GeneSpringGX software (version 11.0).

<P>
Arrays for Totals (input RNA) were summarized by applying the Iterative PLIER16 algorithm using quantile normalization.
Probesets whose normalized expression levels fell within the  18 to 98 percentile in at least two of the three replicates
were retained for further analysis.  These probesets were then subjected to a TTest against zero and a p-value
cutoff of .05 was applied.  The Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate algorithm was applied and a corrected
p-value is also provided.
</P>
<P>
Arrays for T7Tag(background/negative control) RIPs were summarized with those for totals, also using the PLIER16 Iterative
algorithm with quantile normalization.  Probesets whose normalized expression levels fell within the 18 to 98 percentile in at
least two of three replicates in either group (totals or T7Tag RIPs) were retained for further analysis.  Probesets
were then filtered for those that showed a minimum 2 fold increase of expression in T7Tag versus total.  An unpaired TTest
was applied to these probesets and a p-value cutoff of .05 was applied.  The Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate
algorithm was applied and a corrected p-value is also provided.
</P>
<P>
Arrays for treatment RIP samples were summarized together with those for totals and T7Tag RIPs.  Again, this was done using
Iterative PLIER16 with quantile normalization. Probesets whose normalized expression levels fell within the 18 to 98 percentile in at
least two of three replicates in any group (treatment RIPs, totals or T7Tag RIPs) were retained for further analysis.
<br/>A list of probesets was produced of those that showed a minimum 2 fold increase of expression in treatment over total.
A oneway ANOVA was applied and a p-value cutoff of .05 was applied.  The Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate algorithm was applied
and a corrected p-value is also provided.
<br/>A similar list was produced for probesets showing the same enrichment in the T7Tag RIP set.  Probesets which appeared in both
treatment and negative control at these cutoff stringencies were subtracted from the treatment results as background noise, yielding the
final result data track.
