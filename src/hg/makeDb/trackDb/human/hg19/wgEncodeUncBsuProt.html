<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The ENCODE project has revealed the functional elements of segments
of the human genome in unprecedented detail. However, the ability to
clearly distinguish transcripts designated for translation into protein
versus those that serve purely regulatory roles remains elusive. The
standard means for doing this is to measure the proteins, if any, that
are produced by transcripts via mass spectrometry-based proteogenomic
mapping. In this process, chromatographically fractionated peptides are
fed into a tandem mass spectrometer (MS/MS). The series of fragment
masses produced in MS/MS create a signature that can then be used to
identify the peptide from a protein or DNA sequence database. For
proteogenomic mapping, this identifying spectrum is mapped directly
back to its most likely encoding locus on a genome sequence[1]. This
allows the direct verification of protein-encoding transcripts.</p>

<p>The proteogenomic track displays mass spectrometry data that has
been matched to the genomic sequence for selected cell lines, using a
workflow and software specifically designed for this purpose. </p>
<p>The proteogenomic tracks can be used to identify which parts of the
genome are translated into proteins, to verify which transcripts
discovered by ENCODE are protein-encoding, and can also reveal new
genes and/or splice variants of genes. Of particular interest may be
its ability to reveal the translation of small ORFs, antisense
transcripts, or sites annotated as introns that encode proteins.

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>The display for this track shows peptide mappings as
grayscale-colored items where higher scores correspond to
darker-colored blocks.<br>
</p>
<p>In addition to the displayed genomic coordinates, several additional
fields are available for each track item.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Raw Score</span> reflects
the strength of the peptide mapping, in contrast to the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Score</span> field which reflects the
confidence of the mapping. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Score</span>
field is computed as <span style="font-style: italic;">-log10(E-Value) * 100 </span>for
the peptide mapping. Scores of 200 or greater have an estimated 5%
false discovery rate (FDR), while scores of 230 or greater have an estimated 0.5% FDR. 
The <span style="font-style: italic;"> Raw Score </span> offers an additional
level of confidence: raw scores of 300 or greater have an estimated 5%
false discovery rate. Note that <span style="font-style: italic;">Raw
Score</span> is not normalized for the length of the peptide mapping,
while <span style="font-style: italic;">Score</span> is.
Consequently, short mappings might have a strong <span style="font-style: italic;"> Raw Score </span> but a weaker
<span style="font-style: italic;"> Score. </span></li>
  <li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Repeat Count</span>
indicates the number of places in the genome that match the peptide
sequence. This reflects the uniqueness of the peptide mapping in
the genome. Any mappings to highly-duplicated regions will have
high <span style="font-style: italic;"> Repeat Counts </span> and peptides which are repeated more than 10 times in 
the genome are deleted from the track.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Peptide Rank </span> indicates the rank 
of each peptide/spectrum mapping.  A spectrum can be
chimeric, containing more than one peptide, and the spectrum can be mapped with confidence to two or 
more distinct peptides.  Peptides with ranks greater than 3 are deleted from the track.</li>
  <li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Spectrum ID</span> is a
semi-unique identifier of the spectrum associated with the peptide
mapping, and can be used to track the origins of the mapping.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>ENCODE cell lines K562 and GM12878 were used for large scale
proteomic analysis. Cell lines were cultured according to standard
ENCODE cell culture protocols
and in-gel digestion was completed according to the standard
protocol[3]. </p>
The proteolytic enzyme trypsin was used to digest the proteins
in order to produce short, MS/MS analyzable peptides. Trypsin is a
common protease that typically cleaves proteins after R or K. The
metadata parameter <i>enzyme</i> specifies the restriction enzyme used
for digestion. Tandem mass spectrometry (RPLC-MS/MS) analysis was then
performed on an Eksigent Ultra-LTQ Orbitrap system. However, due
to enzyme inefficiency, it does not always cleave at R or K, so there
may be peptides that include an uncleaved R/K site. The number of such
missed cleavages allowed in the search is described by the metadata
parameter <i>miscleavages</i>.
<p>We performed proteogenomic mapping with two missed cleavages
allowed and using the whole human genomic sequence (UCSC hg19) via the
genome fingerprint scanning (GFS) program [2], which uses HMM_Score
[4] to accurately match MS/MS spectra to their corresponding genome
sequences.  E-values are calculated, which estimate the number of
results at the given score level which would be expected by random
chance. We then empirically derived the false discovery rate for a
given E-Value using a decoy database search and only those matches
falling within the specified 5% FDR rate (E-Value <0.01) are included
in the track. The results with 10% FDR (E-Value <0.05) are available
on the Downloads page.
