<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The ENCODE project has revealed the functional elements of segments
of the human genome in unprecedented detail. However, the ability to
clearly distinguish transcripts designated for translation into protein
versus those that serve purely regulatory roles remains elusive. The
standard means for doing this is to measure the proteins, if any, that
are produced by transcripts via mass spectrometry-based proteogenomic
mapping. In this process, chromatographically fractionated peptides are
fed into a tandem mass spectrometer (MS/MS). The series of fragment
masses produced in MS/MS create a signature that can then be used to
identify the peptide from a protein or DNA sequence database. For
proteogenomic mapping, this identifying spectrum is mapped directly
back to its most likely encoding locus on a genome sequence[1]. This
allows the direct verification of protein-encoding transcripts.</p>
<p>The proteogenomic track displays mass spectrometry data that has
been matched to the genomic sequence for selected cell lines, using a
workflow and software specifically designed for this purpose. </p>
<p>The proteogenomic tracks can be used to identify which parts of the
genome are translated into proteins, to verify which transcripts
discovered by ENCODE are protein-encoding, and can also reveal new
genes and/or splice variants of genes. Of particular interest may be
its ability to reveal the translation of small ORFs, antisense
transcripts, or sites annotated as introns that encode proteins
</p>
<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>The display for this track show peptide mappings as
grayscale-colored items where higher scores correspond to
darker-colored blocks.<br>
</p>
<p>In addition to the displayed genomic coordinates, several additional
fields are available for each track item.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Raw Score</span> reflects
the strength of the peptide mapping, in contrast to the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Score</span> field which reflects the
confidence of the mapping. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Score</span>
field is computed as <span style="font-style: italic;">-log10(EValue) </span>for
the peptide mapping, and scores of 130 or greater have an estimated 5%
false positive rate. The Raw Score offers an additional
level of confidence: raw scores of 200 or greater have an estimated 1%
false positive rate. Note that <span style="font-style: italic;">Raw
Score</span> is not normalized for the length of the peptide mapping,
while <span style="font-style: italic;">Score</span> is.
Consequently, short mappings might have a strong raw score but a weaker
score.</li>
  <li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Repeat Count</span>
indicates the number of places in the genome that match the peptide
sequence. This reflects the uniqueness of the peptide mapping in
the genome. Any mappings to highly-duplicated regions will have
high repeat counts.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Peptide Rank </span>reflects
that any single peak in the spectrum can be mapped with confidence to two or 
more distinct peptides.  The reasons for this include that the peak can be
chimeric, containing more than one peptide, and that one peak can match two
or more distinct peptides.  In the cases where a peak maps to multiple peptides,
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Peptide Rank</span> indicates the rank 
of each mapping.</li>
  <li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">spectrum ID</span> is a
semi-unique identifier of the spectrum associated with the peptide
mapping, and can be used to track the origins of the mapping.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>ENCODE cell lines K562 and GM12878 were used for large scale
proteomic analysis. Cell lines were cultured according to standard
ENCODE cell culture protocols
and in-gel digestion was completed according to the standard
protocol[3]. </p>
The proteolytic enzyme <i>trypsin</i> was used to digest the proteins
in order to produce short, MS/MS analyzable peptides. Trypsin is a
common protease that typically cleaves proteins after R or K. The
metadata parameter <i>enzyme</i> specifies the restriction enzyme used
for
digestion. Tandem mass spectrometry (RPLC-MS/MS) analysis was then
performed on an Eksigent Ultra-LTQ Orbitrap system. However, due
to enzyme inefficiency, it does not always cleave at R or K, so there
may be peptides that include an uncleaved R/K site. The number of such
missed cleavages allowed in the search is described by the metadata
parameter <i>miscleavages</i>.
<p>We performed proteogenomic mapping with two miscleavages allowed and
using whole human genomic sequence (UCSC hg19) via the genome
fingerprint scanning (GFS) program [2], which uses HMM_Score [4] to
accurately match MS/MS spectra to their corresponding genome sequences.
E-values are calculated for all results, which estimate the number of
results at the given score level which would be expected by random
chance. The E-values are used to assess the false-positive rate, and
only those matches falling within the specified 5% FPR rate
are included in the track. </p>
