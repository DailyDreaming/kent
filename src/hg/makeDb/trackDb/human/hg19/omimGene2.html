<H2>Description</H2>

<TABLE BORDER = 1 CELLPADDING = 4><TR><TD>
<P><FONT COLOR = RED><B>NOTE</FONT>: OMIM is intended for use
 primarily by physicians and other
professionals concerned with genetic disorders, by genetics researchers, and
by advanced students in science and medicine. While the OMIM database is
open to the public, users seeking information about a personal medical or
genetic condition are urged to consult with a qualified physician for
diagnosis and for answers to personal questions.
</P>
<P>Because the UCSC Genes mappings are based on associations from RefSeq and
UniProt, they are dependent on any interpretations from those sources.
Furthermore, because many OMIM records refer to multiple gene names,
or syndromes not tightly mapped to individual genes, the associations
in this track should be treated with skepticism and any conclusions
based on them should be carefully scrutinized using independent
resources. </B> 
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</P> 

<P>
This track shows the genomic positions of all gene enries
in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(<A HREF="http://www.omim.org/"
TARGET=_blank>OMIM</A>) database.
</P>

<P>OMIM is a compendium of human genes and genetic phenotypes. The full-text, 
referenced overviews in OMIM contain information on all known Mendelian 
disorders and over 12,000 genes. OMIM is authored and edited at the 
McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University 
School of Medicine, under the direction of Dr. Ada Hamosh.  This database 
was initiated in the early 1960s by Dr. Victor A. McKusick as a catalog 
of Mendelian traits and disorders, entitled Mendelian Inheritance
in Man (MIM).

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>Genomic locations of OMIM gene entries are displayed as solid
blocks.  The entries are colored according to following classification:
<UL>
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#C800C8">Purple</FONT></B> for Class 1 OMIM records 
- Reasonable guess at <B><FONT COLOR="#C800C8">association of phenotype 
with gene</FONT></B>, e.g., enzyme deficiencies.  Mapping not definitively 
established.
<LI><B><FONT COLOR=green>Green</FONT></B> for Class 2 OMIM records 
- Phenotype <B><FONT COLOR=green>mapped to region</FONT></B>, but not to gene.
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#DC0000">Red</FONT></B> for Class 3 OMIM records 
- Mutants in <B><FONT COLOR="#DC0000">gene known to cause disease</FONT></B>.
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#DC6464">Orange</FONT></B> for Class 4 OMIM records 
- <B><FONT COLOR="#DC6464"> Contiguous gene syndromes</FONT></B>. 
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#C8C8C8">Gray</FONT></B> for 
<B><FONT COLOR="#C8C8C8">other entries</FONT></B>, mapped to chromosome-band resolution.

</UL>
<P> Gene symbol and disease information, when available, are displayed on the details page for an item. 
</P>

<P>On the main browser display, the description of the OMIM entry are shown when Full display mode is chosen.  In Pack mode, the entry description is shown when mousing over each entry.
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The mappings displayed in this track are based on the mapping between OMIM gene entries and ENTREZ gene IDs:
<UL>
<LI>The OMIM <TT>genemap</TT> data file is downloaded from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/OMIM/genemap.  
The data are loaded into an MySQL table, <TT>omimGeneMap</TT>.
<LI>Entries in <TT>omimGeneMap</TT> table having disorder info are collected into the 
<TT>omimDisorderMap</TT> table.
<LI>The data file, <TT>mim2gene.txt</TT>, from OMIM is loaded into an MySQL table, <TT>mim2gene</TT>.
<LI>From the <TT>mim2gene</TT> table, for each OMIM gene, its ENTREZ gene ID is used to get the corresponding RefSeq gene ID via the <TT>refLink</TT> table.  The RefSeq gene genomic chrom, start, and end data are obtained from the <TT>refGene</TT> table.  Together with the OMIM gene ID, a bed 4 table <TT>omimGene2</tt> is constructed as the primary table for this track.
