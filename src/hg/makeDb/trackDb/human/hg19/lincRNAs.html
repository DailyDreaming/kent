<h2>Description</h2> 

<p>This track displays the Human Body Map lincRNAs (large intergenic non
coding RNAs) and TUCP (transcripts of uncertain coding potential) transcripts, as well as their
expression levels across 22 human tissues and cell lines. The Human Body Map catalog was generated
by integrating previously existing annotation sources with transcripts that were de-novo assembled
from RNA-Seq data collected from ~4 billion RNA-Seq reads across 24 tissues and cell types.
Expression abundance was estimated by Cufflinks (Trapnell et al. 2010) based on RNA-Seq. Expression
abundances were estimated on the gene locus level rather than for each transcript separately and are
given as raw FPKM.  The prefixes tcons_ and tcons_l2_ are used to describe lincRNAs and TUCP
transcripts, respectively. Specific details about the catalog generation and data sets used for this
study can be found at Cabili et al. Genes and Development 2011.  Extended characterization of each
transcript in the human body map catalog can be found at the <a

Catalog</a> website.</p>
