<H2>Description</H2>

<TABLE BORDER = 1 CELLPADDING = 4><TR><TD>
<P><FONT COLOR = RED><B>NOTE</FONT>: OMIM is intended for use
 primarily by physicians and other
professionals concerned with genetic disorders, by genetics researchers, and
by advanced students in science and medicine. While the OMIM database is
open to the public, users seeking information about a personal medical or
genetic condition are urged to consult with a qualified physician for
diagnosis and for answers to personal questions.
</P>
<P>Because the UCSC Genes mappings are based on associations from RefSeq and
UniProt, they are dependent on any interpretations from those sources.
Furthermore, because many OMIM records refer to multiple gene names,
or syndromes not tightly mapped to individual genes, the associations
in this track should be treated with skepticism and any conclusions
based on them should be carefully scrutinized using independent
resources. </B> 
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</P> 

<P>
This track shows the positions of canonical UCSC genes that have been
associated with identifiers in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(<A HREF="http://www.omim.org/"
TARGET=_blank>OMIM</A>) database.
Class 3 OMIM records have been mapped to a specific gene by OMIM,
a compendium of human genes and genetic phenotypes. The full-text, 
referenced overviews in OMIM contain information on all known Mendelian 
disorders and over 12,000 genes. OMIM is authored and edited at the 
McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University 
School of Medicine, under the direction of Dr. Ada Hamosh.  This database 
was initiated in the early 1960s by Dr. Victor A. McKusick as a catalog 
of Mendelian traits and disorders, entitled Mendelian Inheritance
in Man (MIM).

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>Positions of OMIM-associated canonical UCSC genes are displayed as solid
blocks corresponding to the genomic footprint of the canonical isoform 
of the gene. 
<P> Disease information from the OMIM genemap
&quot;disorder&quot; column is displayed on the details page for an item. 
If the canonical UCSC gene represents a cluster of more than one gene, the
other isoforms are listed on the track details page.
</P>
<P>On the main browser display, when <TT>Full</TT> display mode is chosen,
the gene symbol(s) and disease info are shown.  In <TT>Pack</TT> mode, these 
are shown when mousing over each entry.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The mappings displayed in this track are based on the HGNC symbol,
where available, from the UCSC Genes track, associated with OMIM genemap 
entries as follows: 
<UL>
<LI>The OMIM <TT>genemap</TT> data file is downloaded from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/OMIM/genemap.  
The data are loaded into an MySQL table, <TT>omimGeneMap</TT>.
<LI>Entries in <TT>omimGeneMap</TT> table having disorder info are collected into the 
<TT>omimDisorderMap</TT> table.
<LI>A set of UCSC genes was compiled that have cross-references (via same gene symbol) to 
OMIM class 3 genes (defined as "with Known Molecular Basis of Disorder") in the 
<TT>omimDisorderMap</TT> with associated OMIM IDs, as defined in the Genome Browser 
database <TT>kgXref</TT> table.
<LI>Each of the genes in the set was replaced with its associated
canonical gene, based on the UCSC canonical gene set defined by
the <TT>knownIsoforms</TT> and <TT>knownCanonical</TT> tables.
<LI>Duplicates were removed from the canonical set, and the data were
sorted and loaded into the <TT>omimGeneClass3</TT> table.
</UL>

<P>
Thanks to OMIM and NCBI for the use of their data. This track was
constructed by Fan Hsu and Robert Kuhn of the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group.</P>
