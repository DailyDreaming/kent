<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
This track shows DNase hypersensitive areas assayed in a large collection of cell types. 
Regulatory regions in general, and promoters in particular, tend to be DNase sensitive.  

Additional views of this dataset and additional documentation on the methods used
for this track are available at the
<A HREF=../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeAwgDnaseUniform>Uniform DNaseI HS</A> page.  The
uniform peaks in that track are the basis for the clusters shown here,  which combine data from
the peaks of the different cell lines in that page.

<p>
A gray box indicates the extent of the hypersensitive region.  The darkness is proportional to the
maximum signal strength observed in any cell line.  The number to the left of the box shows how
many cell lines are hypersensitive in the region.

This track shows data from the UW and Duke ENCODE groups, with uniform processing by the ENCODE Analysis Working Group.  The clustering was performed at UCSC.
