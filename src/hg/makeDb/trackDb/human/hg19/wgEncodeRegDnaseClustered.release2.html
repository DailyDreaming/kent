<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows DNase hypersensitive areas assayed in a large collection of cell types by the ENCODE project.  Regulatory regions in general, and promoters in particular, tend to be DNase sensitive.  Additional views of this data and additional documentation on the methods used
to identify hypersensitive sites are available from the
<A HREF=../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeAwgDnaseUniform>Uniform DNaseI HS</a> page.  The
uniform peaks in that track are the basis for the clusters shown here,  which combine data from
the peaks different cell lines.
</p>
<h2>Display conventions</h2>
<p>
A gray box indicates the extent of the hypersensitive region.  The darkness is proportional to the
maximum signal strength observed in any cell line.  The number to the left of the box shows how
many cell lines are hypersensitive in the region.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Stringent (FDR 1% thresholded) peaks of DNaseI hypersensitivity from uniform processing  by the ENCODE Analysis Working Group (<a href=../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeAwgDnaseUniform>Uniform DNaseI HS</a>) were assigned normalized scores (using UCSC regClusterMakeTableOfTables) in the range 0-1000 based on the 
<a target=_blank href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format12">narrowPeak</a> signalValue and then clustered on score (using UCSC regCluster) to generate singly-linked clusters.  Low-scoring clusters (score&lt;100) were then filtered out.

<p>
This track shows data from the University of Washington and Duke ENCODE groups, with uniform processing by the ENCODE Analysis Working Group.  The clustering was performed at UCSC.

<h2> Data Release Policy </h2>
<p>While primary ENCODE data is subject to a restriction period as described in the 
<a HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/terms.html" TARGET=_BLANK>
ENCODE data release policy</a>, 
this restriction does not apply to the integrative analysis results.  The data in this track are freely available.
