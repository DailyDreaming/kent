<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays exon microarray expression data from the late mid-fetal
human brain, generated by the Sestan Lab at Yale University. The data represent
13 brain regions, including nine areas of neocortex, and both hemispheres. By
default, arrays are grouped by the median for each brain region, including each
neocortical area. Alternatively, neocortex areas can be grouped together;
arrays can be grouped by mean; or all 95 arrays can be shown individually.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
RNA was isolated from 13 brain regions, from both hemispheres, of four late 
mid-fetal human brains, with a total PMI of less than one hour, and hybridized 
to Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays. Affymetrix CEL files were imported into
Partek GS using Robust Multichip Average (RMA) background correction, quantile
normalization, and GC content correction. The normalized data were then
converted to log-ratios, relative to arrays hybridized with RNA pooled from all
regions of the same brain. Signal log-ratios are displayed here as green for
negative (underexpression) and red for positive (overexpression).
