<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Formaldehyde Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE) is a procedure used to isolate chromatin that is 
resistant to the formation of protein-DNA crosslinks.  These tracks display FAIRE data from 2091 fibroblast cells hybridized to high-resolution <A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="http://www.nimblegen.com/">
NimbleGen</A> arrays that tile the ENCODE regions.  These four datasets, in practical terms, can be thought of as 
independent replicates. However, they represent different cross-linking times (1, 2, 4, and 7 minutes), because 
they were part of a series of experiments aimed at optimizing cross-linking conditions in human cells.  Although they are not displayed,
the individual replicates can be

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The data is represented by two subtracks: one is the average normalized 
log2 ratios for the tiled probes and
the other displays peaks.  Peaks were determined using <em>PeakFinder</em>, software supplied from Nimblegen.  A false positive rate was also 
estimated for the sets of peaks using a permutation based method, all peaks had an FPR<0.01.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
To perform FAIRE, proteins are crosslinked to DNA using 
1% formaldehyde solution, the complex is sheared using sonication, and a phenol/chloroform extraction is performed 
to remove DNA fragments crosslinked to protein.  The DNA recovered in the aqueous phase is fluorescently labeled and 
hybridized to a microarray along with fluorescently labeled genomic DNA as a control.  Ratios are scaled by subtracting the 
Tukey Bi-weight mean for the log-ratio values from each log-ratio value, as recomended by Nimblegen.  Results in yeast are 
consistent with enrichment for nucleosome-depleted regions of the genome. Therefore, the method may have utility as 
a positive selection for genomic regions with properties normally detected by assays like DNAse hypersensitivity. 

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
The data was verified using PCR with primers designed to promoters enriched with FAIRE and downstream coding regions.
