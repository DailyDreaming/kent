<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Formaldehyde Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE) is a procedure used to isolate chromatin that is 
resistant to the formation of protein-DNA crosslinks.  These tracks display FAIRE data from 2091 fibroblast cells hybridized to high-resolution <A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="http://www.nimblegen.com/">
NimbleGen</A> arrays that tile the ENCODE regions.  These four datasets, in practical terms, can be thought of as 
independent replicates. However, they represent different cross-linking times (1, 2, 4, and 7 minutes), because 
they were part of a series of experiments aimed at optimizing cross-linking conditions in human cells.  Although they are not displayed,
the individual replicates can be

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The data are represented by two subtracks: one is the average normalized 
log2 ratios for the tiled probes; the other displays peaks.  
Peaks were determined using <em>PeakFinder</em>, software supplied from 
NimbleGen.  A false positive rate was also 
estimated for the sets of peaks using a permutation-based method. All peaks had 
an FPR of &lt; 0.01.</P>
<P>
This annotation follows the display conventions for composite 
tracks. The subtracks within this annotation 
may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options are shown at the top of 
the track description page, followed by a list of subtracks.  To display only 
one subtrack, uncheck the box next to the track you wish to hide.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
To perform FAIRE, proteins are crosslinked to DNA using 
1% formaldehyde solution, the complex is sheared using sonication, and a phenol/chloroform extraction is performed 
to remove DNA fragments crosslinked to protein.  The DNA recovered in the aqueous phase is fluorescently-labeled and 
hybridized to a microarray along with fluorescently-labeled genomic DNA as a control.  Ratios are scaled by subtracting the 
Tukey Bi-weight mean for the log-ratio values from each log-ratio value, as recomended by NimbleGen.  Results in yeast are 
consistent with enrichment for nucleosome-depleted regions of the genome. Therefore, the method may have utility as 
a positive selection for genomic regions with properties normally detected by assays like DNAse hypersensitivity. </P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
The data was verified using PCR with primers designed to promoters enriched with FAIRE and downstream coding regions. </P>

Cell culture, fixing, and DNA amplification were performed by 
Jonghwan Kim in <A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="http://microarray.icmb.utexas.edu/">Vishy Iyer's lab</A> at the University of 
Texas, Austin.  FAIRE was performed by Paul Giresi in

Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Sample labeling and hybridization was done at NimbleGen by Paul Giresi with the help of
Mike Singer and Roland Green.  Software used for the permutation analysis was supplied by Nan Jiang at NimbleGen.</P>
