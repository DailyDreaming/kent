<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
ChIP-chip analysis of c-Myc and E2F4 was performed using 2091 foreskin fibroblasts and HeLa cells. ChIP was carried out from normally growing HeLa cells and from quiescent (0.1% serum FBS) as well as serum stimulated (10% FBS, 4hrs) 2091 fibroblasts. 
Microarray hybridizations were performed using Nimblegen ENCODE arrays and their protocols.<BR><BR>
</P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Chromatin from each cell line under a given condition was cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, sheared, precipitated with antibody, and reverse crosslinked to obtain enriched DNA fragments. ChIP material was amplified and hybridized to a Nimblegen ENCODE region array. 
The raw and processed files reflect fold enrichment over the mock ChIP sample, which was used as a reference in the hybridization.
</P>
<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Each of the four experiments has three independent biological replicates and data from all three replicates was averaged to generate a single data file. 
The NimbleGen method for hit identification was used to generate the peaks at a false positive rate of <= 0.05.

This data was contributed by Jonghwan Kim, Akshay A Bhinge, and Vishy Iyer from the Iyer lab at the University of Texas at Austin, in collaboration with Mike Singer, Nan Jiang, and Roland Green of NimbleGen Systems, Inc.
