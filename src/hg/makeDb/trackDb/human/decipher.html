<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The 
<A HREF="https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/application/" TARGET= 
_BLANK>DECIPHER</A> database of submicroscopic chromosomal imbalance 
collects clinical information about chromosomal 
microdeletions/duplications/insertions, translocations and inversions 
and displays this information on the human genome map.
<p>
This track shows genomic regions of reported cases and their 
associated phenotype information.  All data have passed the strict
consent requirements of the DECIPHER project and are approved for
unrestricted public release.  Clicking the Patient View ID link
brings up a more detailed informational page on the patient at the 
DECIPHER web site. 
<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
Data provided by the DECIPER project group are imported and processed 
to create a simple BED track to annotate the genomics regions associated 
with individual patients.
