 <B>WHILE THE DECIPHER DATABASE IS 
 OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, USERS SEEKING INFORMATION ABOUT A PERSONAL MEDICAL OR
 GENETIC CONDITION ARE URGED TO CONSULT WITH A QUALIFIED PHYSICIAN FOR
 DIAGNOSIS AND FOR ANSWERS TO PERSONAL QUESTIONS.
 </P>
 <P>BECAUSE THE UCSC GENES MAPPINGS ARE BASED ON ASSOCIATIONS FROM REFSEQ AND
 UNIPROT, THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON ANY INTERPRETATIONS FROM THOSE SOURCES.
 FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE MANY DECIPHER RECORDS REFER TO MULTIPLE GENE NAMES,
 OR SYNDROMES NOT TIGHTLY MAPPED TO INDIVIDUAL GENES, THE ASSOCIATIONS
 IN THIS TRACK SHOULD BE TREATED WITH SKEPTICISM AND ANY CONCLUSIONS
 BASED ON THEM SHOULD BE CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZED USING INDEPENDENT
 RESOURCES.

The 
<A HREF="https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/application/" TARGET= 
_BLANK>DECIPHER</A> database of submicroscopic chromosomal imbalance 
collects clinical information about chromosomal 
microdeletions/duplications/insertions, translocations and inversions 
and displays this information on the human genome map.
<p>
This track shows genomic regions of reported cases and their 
associated phenotype information.  All data have passed the strict
consent requirements of the DECIPHER project and are approved for
unrestricted public release.  Clicking the Patient View ID link
brings up a more detailed informational page on the patient at the 
DECIPHER web site. 
<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
Data provided by the DECIPHER project group are imported and processed 
to create a simple BED track to annotate the genomics regions associated 
with individual patients.  
</P>
<P>
The entries are colored <B><FONT COLOR = RED>red</FONT></B> for deletions (mean ratio < 0) and <B><FONT COLOR = GREEN>green</FONT></B>  for duplications (mean ratio >0).
