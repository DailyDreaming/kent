<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the locations of transcriptionally active regions 
(TARs)/transcribed fragments (transfrags) hybridized to an oligonucleotide 
microarray whose design was based on human assembly hg13 (NCBI Build 31).

<H2>Methods</H2>

Microarrays were designed using sequence from the human hg13 assembly. The
genome sequence was screened for repetitive elements and low-complexity DNA
using RepeatMasker in the sensitive mode. Additional low-complexity filtering
was performed using the NSEG program using a minimum segment length of 21
nucleotides. After filtering, 1.5 Gb of nonrepetitive DNA remained and 
microarray probes were chosen using the NASA Oligonucleotide Probe Selection
Algorithm (NOPSA). This resulted in probes chosen based on several criteria:
1) Every 36-mer in the genome is unique; 2) Sequences that could form a loop
with a stem of > 7 bp were excluded; 3) Other factors such as sequence length, 
extent of complemntarity and base composition. A total of 51,874,388 36-mer 
oligonucleotide probes were selected from both the sense and antisense strands
at an average resolution of 46 bp to cover the non-repetitive sequence from
the whole genome. Probes were spaced every 10 nt on average. The probes were 
synthesized via maskless photolithography at a feature density of 
approximately 390,000 probes per slide.

Biological samples that were hybridized to the arrays consisted of 
triple-selected polyadenylated RNA pooled from several individuals (supplied 
by Ambion).
