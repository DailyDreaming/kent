<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the locations of transcriptionally active regions 
(TARs)/transcribed fragments (transfrags) hybridized to an oligonucleotide 
microarray whose design was based on human assembly hg13 (NCBI Build 31).</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Microarrays were designed using sequence from the human hg13 assembly. The
genome sequence was screened for repetitive elements and low-complexity DNA
using RepeatMasker in the sensitive mode. Additional low-complexity filtering
was performed using the NSEG program using a minimum segment length of 21
nucleotides. After filtering, 1.5 Gb of nonrepetitive DNA remained and 
microarray probes were chosen using the NASA Oligonucleotide Probe Selection
Algorithm (NOPSA). This resulted in probes chosen based on several criteria:
1) Every 36-mer in the genome is unique; 2) Sequences that could form a loop
with a stem of &gt; 7 bp were excluded; 3) Other factors such as sequence length, 
extent of complemntarity and base composition. A total of 51,874,388 36-mer 
oligonucleotide probes were selected from both the sense and antisense strands
at an average resolution of 46 bp to cover the non-repetitive sequence from
the whole genome. Probes were spaced every 10 nt on average. The probes were 
synthesized via maskless photolithography at a feature density of 
approximately 390,000 probes per slide.</P>

<P>
Biological samples that were hybridized to the arrays consisted of 
triple-selected poly(A)+ RNA pooled from several individuals (supplied 
by Ambion). One biological replicate was carried out.</P>

<P>
The TARs identified for hg13 (NCBI Build 31) were mapped to this
assembly using Blat.  The program, pslCDnaFilter, was used to filter 
alignments using the following parameters:
<TT>-minId=0.96</TT>,<TT> -minCover=0.25</TT>,
<TT> -localNearBest=0.001</TT>,<TT>-minQSize=20</TT>,
<TT> -minNonRepSize=16</TT>,<TT> -ignoreNs</TT>,<TT> -bestOverlap</TT></P>

<H2>Display Conventions</H2>
<P>
TARs are represented by blocks in the graphical display. The numeric part of 
the ID displayed when the track has pack or full visibility, is the ID used
by the Database for Active Regions with Tools (DART) at Yale. A link to 
this database is given on the details page for each TAR.</P>

<H2>Data Analysis</H2>
<P>
Two groups of TARs were identified: &quot;normal&quot; and 
&quot;poly(A) associated&quot;.</P>

<H3>Normal TARs:</H3> 
<P>
Clusters of transcription units were identified that consisted of at least 
five consectutive probes whose fluorescence intensities were in the top 
90th intensity percentile and whose genomic coordinates lay within a 250-nt 
window. After collecting thse regions genome-wide, their locations were 
compared relative to those of annotated components of genes. As a result, a
total of 13,889 transcription units, ranging in size from 209 to 3438 nt, 
were identified. Under the null hypothesis of zero transcription, only 400
were expected to be found. Of those regions identified, one-third (4931) 
correspond to previously annotated exons while the other 8958 are new 
transribed sequences that are referred to as TARs.</P>

<H3>Poly(A) associated TARs:</H3> 
<P>
Another set of criteria was used to find TARs in which the probe hybridization 
intensities were correlated with the presence of a polyadenylation signal 3' 
to the TAR.  Transcription units of five consecutive probes whose fluroscence 
intensities were in the top 80th intensity percentile and in a window of 250 nt.
The 3' region also must contain or be close to a polyadenylation signal.
Transcription units with an associated polyadenylation signal of 
&quot;AATAAA&quot;, were assigned to a type I group while those with 
&quot;ATTAAA&quot; were type II. Only 100 of 
these should occur at random in the genome under the null hypothesis of zero
transcription. The majority (1991) were found to be within annotated exons, 
and 952 were located more than 10 kb from an annotated gene. A total of 1371 
type I and 674 type II poly(A) sequences were identified within exons of 
known genes. 1289 (94%) of type I and 607 (90%) of type II instances were 
found to be in the 3' exon of the gene.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
The TARs were validated using RT-PCR on human liver poly(A)+ RNA. 48 poly(A) 
associated and 48 non poly(A) associated TARs were investigated. In 94% (90/96)
cases, the PCR products were found to be of the expected size in a 
single-pass assay.</P>
