<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays the trend p-values (-log<sub>10</sub>) of the seven diseases reported by the 
Case Control Consortium in their Nature paper.  Those diseases are:
<UL>
<LI>Bipolar disorder</LI>
<LI>Coronary artery disease</LI>
<LI>Crohn's disease</LI>
<LI>Hypertension</LI>
<LI>Rheumatoid arthritis</LI>
<LI>Type 1 diabetes</LI>
<LI>Type 2 diabetes</LI>
</UL></P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Reported trend p-values are taken for each of the Affy 500k probes on the genome, 
then logged and multiplied by -1 for visualization purposes.  Most of chromosome X data is
omitted because of the difference in statistical power and the difference in 
control sets used.  The genotypic p-value is not used for this track, because the
trend p-value captures the majority of the associated signals anyway.
