<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track is the union of the eleven subtracks from the Intergenic
Distal composite track collapsed into this single track.
</P>
<P>
This track is the collection of all the TransFrags/TARS from
the Yale and Affy transfrags tracks, selected to be outside
the transcript coding region of the Gencode genes and at least
5000 base pairs distant from any exon coding region of the Gencode genes.
Thus, these are the TransFrags/TARS in the Intergenic ENCODE areas.
