<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
These tracks summarize results of DNaseI hypersensitivity assays from a series of amplicons tiled along a target region 
performed by high-throughput quantitative PCR.  
This quanitative chromatin profiling (QCP) approach can identify DNaseI hypersensitive site core elements and associated cis-regulatory sequences<BR><BR>

This track displays DNaseI hypersensitive sites / probability scores.</h4>  

This track identifies amplicons overlying DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs), and also provides an empirical p value for each.  
Note that these are empirically determined p values, not binomial/Gaussian p values.  
Note also that HSs are only called in the context of plates with an acceptable (though conservative) plate quality score (see below).<br><br>



<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
As part of the analysis of DNaseI sensitivity, p values were calculated for each amplicon by an empirical method.  
The values are represented on a vertical axis as a score between 0 and 3, corresponding to -log(10)(p value) (i.e., score of 3 = p less than .001).  
Amplicons with p greater than 0.05 are assigned p values of 1 which becomes the baseline value 0 when transformed for plotting.  
Note that these are empirically determined p values, not binomial/Gaussian p values.  
Note also that HSs are only called in the context of plates with an acceptable (though conservative) plate quality score (see below).<br><br>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
QCP measurements are performed in replicate (6X) on pooled biological replicate samples.  Validation of results was carried out by conventional DNaseI hypersensitivity assays using end-labeling/Southern blotting.  A total of 1.17Mb have been evaluated by conventional assay.  The specificity is defined as the number of true negative evaluable QCP amplicons divided by the sum of the true negatives plus false positives.  Using 246.2 kb from ENm002 the specificity was calculated to be 0.997. The sensitivity of the QCP assay is calculated as the true positives divided by the sum of the true positives plus false negatives.  The sensitivity measured for ENm002 was 0.9487.
