constrained elements exhibit significant evidence of the effects of purifying selection.  
Elements are scored according to the inferred intensity of purifying selection, and are measured as 
"rejected substitutions" (RS).  RS capture the magnitude of difference
between the number of "observed" substitutions (estimated using maximum
likelihood) and the number that would be "expected" under a neutral model 
of evolution.   The RS is displayed as part of the item name, and items with
higher RS's are displayed in a darker shade of blue.  The "score" listed in
the details page is generally not as accurate as the RS count that is part of
the item name.
<P>
Analyses are based on alignments of human ENCODE genomic DNA to many 
other mammals using the 
<a href="http://lagan.stanford.edu/lagan_web/index.shtml" TARGET=_blank>LAGAN</a> 
alignment package.
<H2>Methods</H2>
The GERP method relies on maximal likelihood to estimate the
difference between observed and expected substitution rates.
The expected and observed rates are both calculated on phylogenic 
tree using the same, fixed topology.  The branch lengths of the 
expected tree are based on the average substitutions at neutral sites.  
The observed tree is calculated separately for each human base.  The 
branch lengths of the observed tree is based on the substitutions seen 
at the column of the multiple alignment at that base.  Species which 
have gaps at a particular column are not considered in the estimation for that
column.
<P>
"Constrained elements" are identified as those groups
of consecutive human bases that have an observed rate of evolution that is
smaller than the expected rate.  These groups of columns are merged if they
are less than a few nucleotides apart, and scored according to the sum of 
the site-by-site difference between observed and expected rates (RS).

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
We analyze permutations of the actual alignments, and treat 
"constrained elements" identified in these permuted alignments as 
"false positives".  We subsequently pick an RS threshold such that the 
total length of "false positive" (that is, identified in the permuted
alignments) constrained elements is less than 5% of the length of constrained
elements identified in the actual alignment.  
Thus, all annotated constrained elements are significant at better
than 95% confidence, and the total fraction of the ENCODE regions 
annotated as constrained is 5-7%.
