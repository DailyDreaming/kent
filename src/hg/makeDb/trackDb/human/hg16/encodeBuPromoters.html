<h2>Description</h2>
<P>
This track displays expression levels of first and a constitutive exons of
genes in ENCODE regions, based on a real competitive Polymerase Chain
Reaction (rcPCR) technique described in <a href="#References">Ding
et al. 2003</a>. Expression levels
are indicated by color, ranging from black (no expression) to red (high
expression). Experiments were performed on total RNA samples of ten
normal human tissues, purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The
tissues
are cerebral cortex, colon, heart, kidney, liver, lung,
skeletal muscle, spleen, stomach, and testis.<br>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<P>
The rcPCR technique combines competitive PCR and Matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)
for gene expression analysis. To measure the expression level of a
gene, an oligonucleotide standard (60-80 bases; its concentration is
known) complementary to the target sequence, except for a single base
mismatch in the middle, is added as the competitor for PCR. The gene of
interest and the oligonucleotide standard resemble two alleles of a
heterozygous locus in an allele frequency analysis experiment, and thus
can be analyzed with the quantified by the high-throughput MALDI-TOF MS
based MassARRAY system (Sequenom Inc.). After PCR, a base extension
reaction is carried out with an extension primer, a ThermoSequenase and
a mixture of ddNTPs/dNTP. The extension primer anneals to the immediate
5 &#8217;-upstream sequence of the mismatch position. Depending on the nature
of the mismatch and the mixture composition of ddNTPs/dNTP, one or two
bases are added to the extension primer, producing two extension
products with one base-length difference. These two extension products
are then detected and quantified by the high-throughput MALDI-TOF MS
based MassARRAY system (Sequenom Inc.).<br>
</p>
<p>
Alternative transcription start sites (TSS) for 20 ENCODE genes were predicted
using our in-house computational tool PromoSer (<a
 TARGET=_BLANK href="http://biowulf.bu.edu/zlab/Promoser/">http://biowulf.bu.edu/zlab/Promoser/</a>).
PromoSer computationally identifies the TSS by considering alignments
of a large number of partial and full-length mRNA sequences and ESTs to
genomic DNA, with provision for alternative promoters. In PromoSer, the
treatment of alternative first exons (or the resulting TSSs) is as
follows. All transcripts (mRNA, full length mRNA and EST) deemed to
belong to the same gene cluster are examined. Individual ESTs were not
considered for alternative TSSs and only the 5' most position from all
ESTs in the cluster was considered a potential TSS. If multiple 5'-end
positions were more than 20 bp apart, they were reported as alternative
TSSs.</p>
<p>
For each gene, we identified all alternative first exons based on manual
selections of PromoSer predictions. We also selected an exon that is
shared by all transcripts (called the constitutive exon). It should be
noted that the amplicons are designed according to transcript sequences
and can span a large distance on the genomic sequence. In addition,
some amplicons are designed across the junctions between first exons
and the constitutive second exons, and thus these amplicons may overlap
with the amplicons that correspond to the constitutive second exons. <br>
</p>
<p>
The nomenclature of each alternative transcript is such that the gene name
is followed by an identifier for the alternative first exon or the
constitutive exon. For example, for gene CAV1, there are three
alternative first exons (CAV1-E1A, CAV1-E1B, and CAV1-E1C) and the
third exon is chosen as the constitutively expressed exon (CAV1-E3).
The absolute expression levels of all exons are individually quantified
by rcPCR by designing four assays with PCR amplicons corresponding to
each exon. Their expression ratios (CAV1-E1A/CAV1-E3, CAV1-E1B/CAV1-E3,
CAV1-E1C/CAV1-E3) indicate the relative abundance of the three
alternative first exons. 10 different tissue types are used for the
expression analysis. We used 18S rRNA for exon absolute expression
normalization among different tissues.<br>
</p>
<p>
Values shown on this
track represent the relative abundance of the alternative first exons
with
respect to the 18S rRNA. The values have been scaled to show graded
colors on the browser.
</p>
<h2>Verification</h2>
<p>
One biological replicate has been performed for all the genes. Two to four
competitor concentrations have been used to detect the expression level
of each exon. Two to six technical replicates have been performed for
each competitor concentration. We plan to do one more biological
replicate in the future.<br>
