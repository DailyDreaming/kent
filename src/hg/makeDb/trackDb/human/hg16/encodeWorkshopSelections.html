<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This annotation is a collection of selected non-coding Affy transcribed 
fragments (transfrags) and Yale transcriptionally-active regions (TARs) from 
the Affy Transfrags and Yale TAR annotation tracks, grouped into subsets based
on their proximity to the transcript-coding and exon-coding regions of 
GenCode genes. Each subtrack shows the union of data from the eleven 
related individual subtracks in the Unann Transfrags track. </P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Consensus Intronic Proximal: </B>
shows all transfrags/TARs within Gencode genes introns that are proximal to a 
Gencode genes exon, <em>i.e.</em> are within a Gencode genes transcript-coding 
region and are within 5000 bases of a Gencode genes exon-coding region.
<LI>
<B>Consensus Intronic Distal: </B>
shows all transfrags/TARs within Gencode genes introns that are not near an 
exon, <em>i.e.</em> are within a Gencode genes transcript-coding region, but at 
least 5000 base pairs away from any Gencode genes exon-coding region.
<LI>
<B>Consensus Intergenic Proximal: </B>
shows all transfrags/TARs in the ENCODE intergenic regions that are proximal to 
a Gencode genes exon, <em>i.e.</em> are outside the Gencode genes 
transcript-coding regions, but are within 5000 base pairs of a Gencode genes 
exon-coding region.
<LI>
<B>Consensus Intergenic Distal: </B>
shows all transfrags/TARs in the ENCODE intergenic regions that are not near an 
exon,
<em>i.e.</em> are outside the Gencode genes transcript-coding regions and at 
least 5000 base pairs away from any of the Gencode genes exon-coding regions.

<B>NOTE: </B>As of 29 July, 2005, the exact positions of the data in these 
tracks are under investigation for a suspected off-by-one error.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This annotation track is comprised of subtracks that show
different aspects of the displayed data. The complete list of subtracks 
is displayed near the top of the track description page. To display only 
selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
This annotation track was derived from data contained in the Yale TAR, Affy 
Transfrags, and Gencode Genes annotation tracks using the UCSC Table Browser. 
See the description pages associated with these annotation tracks for more 
information about the data sets. </P>
