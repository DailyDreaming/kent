<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
These tracks are the union of the eleven individual subtracks from each
of the specified regions, Intergenic or Intronic, Distal or Proximal.
</P>
<H3>Intergenic Distal</H3>
<P>
This track is the collection of all the TransFrags/TARS from
the Yale and Affy transfrags tracks, selected to be outside
the transcript coding region of the Gencode genes and at least
5000 base pairs distant from any exon coding region of the Gencode genes.
Thus, these are the TransFrags/TARS in the Intergenic ENCODE areas.
</P>
<H3>Intergenic Proximal</H3>
<P>
This track is the collection of all the TransFrags/TARS from
the Yale and Affy transfrags tracks, selected to be outside
the transcript coding region of the Gencode genes, and
within 5000 bases of the exon coding regions of the Gencode
genes.  Thus, this set are the TransFrags/TARS in the Intergenic
ENCODE regions, and nearby to the Gencode genes.
</P>
<H3>Intronic Distal</H3>
<P>
This track is the collection of all the TransFrags/TARS from
the Yale and Affy transfrags tracks, that are within the
transcript region of Gencode genes, but at least 5000 base
pairs distant from any exon coding region of the Gencode genes.
Thus, these are the TransFrags/TARS within the Gencode introns.
</P>
<H3>Intronic Proximal</H3>
<P>
This track is the collection of all the TransFrags/TARS from
the Yale and Affy transfrags tracks, selected to be within
the transcript coding region of the Gencode genes, and
within 5000 bases of the exon coding regions of the Gencode
genes.  Thus, this set are the TransFrags/TARS within
the introns of the Gencode genes and nearby to the exons.

This data was collected directly from the UCSC Genome
browser via the Table Browser.

<H2><EM>NOTE:</EM></H3>
<P>
As of 29 July 2005, the exact location of these tracks is being
investigated.  There is a suspected off-by-one error in their
location.
