<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track is the collection of all the TransFrags/TARS from
the Yale and Affy transfrags tracks, selected to be outside
the transcript coding region of the Gencode genes, and
within 5000 bases of the exon coding regions of the Gencode
genes.  Thus, this set are the TransFrags/TARS in the Intergenic
ENCODE regions, and nearby to the Gencode genes.
