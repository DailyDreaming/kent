<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays the 3-way Regulatory Potential (RP) Score, computed 
from alignments of human (hg16, Oct 03), mouse (mm3, Feb 03) and rat 
(rn3, Jun 03). RP scores compare frequencies of short alignment patterns 
between regulatory elements and neutral DNA. 
<P>
The default display range for the track is 0 to 0.1. Score values 
at or below 0 indicate resemblance to alignment patterns typical of 
neutral DNA and are truncated and displayed at 0. Score values at or above 
0.1 indicate very marked resemblance to alignment patterns typical of 
regulatory elemenents and are truncated and displayed at 0.1. Absence of a 
score value at a given location indicates lack of alignment.
<P>
Preliminary results from a calibration study investigating sensitivity 
and specificity of the 3-way RP score on the hemoglobin beta gene 
cluster suggest the use of a threshold ~ 0.0002 for identifying new 
putative regulatory elements.
<P>
(A 3-way RP score computed from alignments of human, mouse and rat
is also available on this browser).

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The comparison employs log-ratios of transitions probabilities from two 
Markov models. Training the score entails selecting appropriate alphabet
(alignment column symbols) and order (length of the patterns=order+1) for 
the Markov models, and estimating their transition probabilities, based on 
alignment data from known regulatory elements and ancestral repeats.
The 3-way RP score uses a 10-symbol alphabet and order 2.
<P>
In the track, score values are displayed using a system of overlapping 
windows of size 100bp along aligned portions of the human sequence. 
Log-ratios are added over positions in a window, and the sum is normalized 
for length.

Comparative Genomics and
Bioinformatics Center at Penn State University</A>.
More information on this research and the collection of known regulatory 
elements used in training the score can be found at this site.

Mouse and rat sequence data were provided by the Mouse and Rat Sequencing 
Consortia. The alignment data were created in collaboration with the UCSC 
Genome Bioinformatics group.
