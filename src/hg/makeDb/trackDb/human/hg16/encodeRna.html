<H2> Description </H2>
<P>
This track shows the location of known and predicted non-protein coding RNA genes and
pseudogenes that fall within the encode regions.  It contains all information in Sean
Eddy's RNA gene track for these regions combined with computational predictions generated 
by Jakob Skou Pedersen's evoFold algorithm.  In addition to the fields contained in the RNA gene
track, this track also includes encode-related fields describing overlap with transcribed 
regions and repeats.</P>

<H2> Methods </H2>
<P>
The RNA Gene track was supplemented with Jakob Skou Pedersen's evoFold predictions and filtered down
to entries that lie within the Encode regions.  Regions that are at least 10 percent 
repeatmasked are flagged because no transcriptional data is available for them.  A region is
considered transcribed if at least 10 percent overlaps with any Affymetrix transfrag (derived 
from 6 microarray experiments) or Yale TAR (derived from 15 microarray experiments.)  Each
array is listed from which the overlapped transfrags and TARs were derived.
