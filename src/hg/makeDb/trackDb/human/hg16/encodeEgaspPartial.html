<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
Data for each gene prediction method within this composite annotation track 
are displayed in separate subtracks. See the top of the track description page 
for a complete list of the subtracks available for this annotation. To display
only selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to
hide.  
<P>
The individual subtracks within this annotation follow the display conventions 
for <A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay">gene prediction
tracks</A>. The track description page offers the option 
to color and label codons in a zoomed-in display of the subtracks to facilitate 
validation and comparison of gene predictions. To enable this feature, select 
the <em>genomic codons</em> option from the &quot;Color track by codons&quot;
menu. Click the
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgCodonColoring.html">Help on codon coloring</A>
link for more information about this feature. </P>
<P>
Color differences among the subtracks are arbitrary. They provide a
visual cue for distinguishing the different gene prediction methods.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>

<H3>ACEScan</H3>
<P>
ACE is an acronym for &quot;alternative conserved exons&quot;, 
indicating alternative splicing that is evolutionarily conserved in human and 
mouse/rat. ACE[+]exons are predicted alternative conserved exons. ACE[-]exons 
are predicted to be constitutive or may have species-specific alternative 
splicing. <P>
</UL>

<H3>ASPic</H3>
<P>
ASPic (Alternative Splicing Prediction) is a web-based tool that detects the 
exon-intron structure of a gene by comparing its genomic sequence to the 
related cluster of ESTs.  ASPic predicts constitutive and alternative splice 
sites through a novel methodology that uses a combined analysis of all EST 
alignments to make them most compatible to a common exon-intron structure of 
the gene considered. </P>

<H3>Augustus</H3>
<P>
Augustus is a generalized hidden Markov model (GHMM) that
models coding and non-coding sequence, splice sites, the branch point region, 
translation start and end, and lengths of exons and introns. The track 
contains four different sets of predictions. <em>Ab initio</em>
single genome predictions are based solely on the input sequence. EST and
protein evidence predictions were generated using AGRIPPA hints based on 
alignments of human sequence from the dbEST and nr databases. Mouse homology 
gene predictions were produced using mouse genomic sequence only; BLAST, CHAOS, 
DIALIGN were used to generate the hints for Augustus. The combined 
EST/protein evidence and mouse homology gene predictions were created using 
human sequence from the dbEST and nr databases and mouse genomic sequence to 
generate hints for Augustus.</P>

<H3>GeneZilla</H3>
<P>
GeneZilla is a program for the computational prediction of protein-coding genes 
in eukaryotic DNA, based on the generalized hidden Markov model (GHMM) 
framework. These predictions were generated using GeneZilla and isochore-finder 
IsoScan.</P>
