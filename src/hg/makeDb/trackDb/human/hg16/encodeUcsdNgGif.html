<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays results of the following ChIP/chip (Nimblegen) 
gamma interferon experiments on HeLa cells:
<UL>
<LI> H3K4me3, no gamma interferon</LI>
<LI> H3K4me3, 30 minutes after gamma interferon</LI>
<LI> RNA Pol II, no gamma interferon</LI>
<LI> RNA Pol II, 30 minutes after gamma interferon</LI>
</UL>

</P><P>
Genome-wide location analysis of trimethylated K4 histone H3 (H3K4me3,
or triMeH3K4) and RNA polymerase II was conducted employing ChIP/chip
using chromatin extracted from HeLa cells both induced for 30 minutes with
gamma interferon and uninduced.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Chromatin from both induced and uninduced HeLa cells was separately
cross-linked, precipitated with different antibodes, sheared,
amplified and hybridized to an oligonucleotide tiling array produced by 
<A HREF="http://www.nimblegen.com/" TARGET=_BLANK>Nimblegen Systems</A>. 
The array includes non-repetitive sequences within the 44 ENCODE
regions tiled from NCBI Build 35 (UCSC hg17) with 50-mer probes at 38
bp interval.  Coordinates were translated to NCBI Build 34 (UCSC
hg16).
</P><P>
Intensity values for biological replicate arrays were combined after
quantile normalization using 
<A HREF="http://www.r-project.org/" TARGET=_BLANK>R</A>.  
The averages of the quantile
normalized intensity values for each probe were then median scaled and
Loess-normalized using R to obtain the adjusted logR-values.
</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Three biological replicates were used to generate the track for each
factor in each time point with the exception of RNA Pol II uninduced
for which only two biological replicates were used.
