<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<P>
Genome-wide location analysis of histones H3 and H4. with antibodies
H3K4me2, H3K4me3, acH3, acH4 and STAT1,
was conducted employing ChIP/chip using chromatin extracted from HeLa
cells both induced for 30min with interferon-gamma and uninduced.
The H3K4me2, H3K4me, and acH3 forms of histone H3 is associated with
up-regulation of gene expression as is the acH4 form of histone H4.  STAT1
(signal transducer and activator of transcription) binds to DNA and activates
transcription in response to various cytokines including interferon-gamma.
</P>

<h2>METHODS</h2>

<P>
Chromatin from both induced and uninduced cells was separately cross-linked,
precipitated with the antibodies, sheared, amplified and hybridized
to a PCR DNA tiling array, produced at the Ren Lab at UC San Diego,
composed of 24,537 non-repetitive sequences within the 44 ENCODE regions.
</P>

<P>
For each state, there are three or more biological replicates. Each experiment
is loess-normalized using R; the P-value and R-value are calculated using the
modified single array error model (Li, Z. <em>et al</em>., 2003). The P-value
and R-value are then derived from the weighted average results of the
replicates.
</P>

<P>
The displayed values are scaled to 0-16, corresponding to negative log base
10 of the P-value.
</P>

<h2>VERIFICATION</h2>

<P>
There are three biological replicates for each of the two experiments.
