<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
This track displays the 2-way Regulatory Potential Score, computed 
from alignments of human (hm16, Oct 03) and mouse (mm4, Oct 03).
<p></p>
RP scores compare frequencies of short alignment patterns between 
regulatory elements and neutral DNA. 
<p></p> 
The default display range for the track goes from 0 to 0.1. Score values 
at or below 0 indicate resemblance with alignment patterns typical of 
neutral DNA, and are truncated and displayed at 0. Score values at or above 
0.1 indicate very marked resemblance with alignment patterns typical of 
regulatory elemenents, and are truncated and displayed at 0.1. Absence of a 
score value at a given location indicates lack of alignment.
<p></p>
Preliminary results from a calibration study investigating sensitivity 
and specificity of the 2-way RP score on the hemoglobin beta gene 
cluster suggest the use of a threshold right above 0 for identifying new 
putative regulatory elements.
<p></p>
(A 3-way RP score, computed from alignments of human, mouse and rat
is also available on this browser).

<H2>Methods</H2>

<p>
The comparison employs log-ratios of transitions probabilities from two 
Markov models. Training the score entails selecting appropriate alphabet
(alignment column symbols) and oder (length of the patterns=order+1) for 
the Markov models, and estimating their transition probabilities, based on 
alignment data from known regulatory elements and ancestral repeats.
The 2-way RP score uses a 5-symbol alphabet, and order 5.
</p><p>
In the track, score values are displayed using a system of overlapping 
windows of size 100bp along aligned portions of the human sequence 
(log-ratios are added over positions in a window, and the sum normalized 
for length).
