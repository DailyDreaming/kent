<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
These tracks summarize results of DNaseI hypersensitivity assays from a series of amplicons tiled along a target region performed by high-throughput quantitative PCR.  
This quanitative chromatin profiling (QCP) approach can identify DNaseI hypersensitive site core elements and associated cis-regulatory sequences<BR><BR>

<h4>Plate quality score.</h4>  This track provides a visual representation of a plate quality score with values between 0 and 1.  
Plates with score >0.5 are conservatively considered acceptable for HS scoring, as above.  <br><br>



<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Plate quality scores were computed using a Support Vector Machine (SVM).  Trained operators manually scored 500 plates, classifying each on a scale of 1-5 ranking 
the degree of experimental noise.  The unified set was then used to train an SVM to classify and score 'good' and 'bad' plates.  
We conservatively assigned good plates to noise scores 1-3 and bad plates to scores 4-5.  By performing cross validation on a 90% subsample of the training set, 
the SVM achieved an ROC score of 0.93.<br><br>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
QCP measurements are performed in replicate (6X) on pooled biological replicate samples.  Validation of results was carried out by conventional DNaseI 
hypersensitivity assays using end-labeling/Southern blotting.  A total of 1.17Mb have been evaluated by conventional assay.  
The specificity is defined as the number of true negative evaluable QCP amplicons divided by the sum of the true negatives plus false positives.  
Using 246.2 kb from ENm002 the specificity was calculated to be 0.997. The sensitivity of the QCP assay is calculated as the true positives 
divided by the sum of the true positives plus false negatives.  The sensitivity measured for ENm002 was 0.9487.
