<H2>Description</H2>
<P>

Observations from sperm-studies (Jeffreys et al. 2001, etc) and patterns of 
genetic variation (Mcvean et al. 2004, Crawford et al. 2004) show
that recombination rates in human vary extensively over kilobase scales, and
that much recombination occurs in recombination hotspots, providing
an explanation for the apparent block-like structure of linkage 
disequlibrium (Daly et al. 2001, Gabriel et al. 2002)
<P>
Statistical methods for estimating the fine-scale structure of recombination
rate variation from genetic variation have been developed and validated.
These have a resolution at the kilobase level, several orders in magnitude 
greater than traditional pedigree-based genetic maps.
<P>
Fine-scale recombination rate estimates provide a new route to
understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying human recombination.
A better understanding of the genomic landscape of human recombination
rate variation would facilitate the efficient design and analysis of
disease association studies and greatly improve inferences from
polymorphism data about selection and human demographic history.
<P>
This track shows recombination rates measured in
centiMorgans/megabase in 10 ENCODE regions.

<H2>Validation</H2>
<P>

This approach has been validated in three ways: by extensive
simulation studies and by comparisons with independent estimates of
recombination rates, both over large scales from the genetic map and
over fine scales from sperm analysis.  Full details of validation can be 
found in McVean et al. (2004) and Winckler et al. (2005).

<H2>Credits</H2>
The data is based on HapMap release 16.
The recombination rates were ascertained by Gil McVean.
