<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays activity levels of 643 putative promoter fragments
in the ENCODE regions, based on high-throughput transient transfection
luciferase reporter assays.  The activity of each putative promoter is
indicated by color, ranging from black (no activity) to red(strong
activity).  Each of the fragments was tested in a panel of 16 cell
lines:

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Promoters in the ENCODE region were predicted using a variation on methods
previously described (Trinklein et al., 2003, Trinklein et al.,
2004). Using alignments of human cDNAs in Genbank to the genome,
those with at least one base pair of exon overlap were merged,
generating gene models. The transcription start sites were predicted
by assigning the 5' end of each gene model as one transcription start
site and alternative 5' ends that were at least 500 bp downstream and
supported by full-length cDNAs as other start sites. Promoters were 
defined as the regions approximately 600 bp upstream and 100 base pairs 
downstream of each transcription start site. 
</P>
<P>
Primer3 was used to pick primers yielding approximately 500 base pair
amplicons containing the predicted transcription start site. Each
fragment of DNA represented in this track was cloned into a
luciferase reporter vector (pGL3-Basic, Promega) using the BD
Clontech Infusion Cloning System. The Dual Luciferase system
(Promega) was used to co-transfect the experimental DNA along with a
control plasmid expressing Renilla in 96-well format into one of the
sixteen cell types using FuGENE Transfection Reagent (Roche). Each
transfection was done in duplicate. 
</P>
<P>
Data are reported as normalized and log transformed averages of the
Luciferase/Renilla ratio. This normalization was based on the
activity of 102 random genomic fragments. Such a normalization allows
for a meaningful comparison between cell types. 
</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Data were verified by repeating the preparation and measurement of
48 random fragments. No significant variation between the two
preparations was detected.
