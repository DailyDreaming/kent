<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track is the union of the eleven subtracks from the Intronic
Proximal composite track collapsed into this single track.
</P>
<P>
This track is the collection of all the TransFrags/TARS from
the Yale and Affy transfrags tracks, selected to be within
the transcript coding region of the Gencode genes, and
within 5000 bases of the exon coding regions of the Gencode
genes.  Thus, this set are the TransFrags/TARS within
the introns of the Gencode genes and nearby to the exons.
