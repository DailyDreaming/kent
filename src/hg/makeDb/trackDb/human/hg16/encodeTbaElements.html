<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays multi-species conserved elements (MCSs)
derived from binCons, phastCons, and 
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="http://mendel.stanford.edu/sidowlab/downloads/ABC_GERP/abcgerp.html">GERP</A>
conservation scoring
of Threaded Blockset Aligner (TBA) multiple sequence alignments in the 
ENCODE regions.
The multiple sequence alignments are displayed in the TBA Alignments
track and the conservation scoring is shown in the TBA Conservation
track.  The descriptions for these tracks provide details
of the methods used for creating the alignments and conservation.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The locations of conserved elements are indicated by blocks in the graphical
display.</P>
 
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
<H3>BinCons-based Elements</H3>
<P>
For each ENCODE target, a conservation score threshold was picked to match
the number of conserved bases predicted by phastCons, an alternative method
for measuring conservation. This latter method has been found slightly more
reliable for predicting the expected fraction of conserved sequence 
in each target. Clusters of bases
that exceeded the given conservation score threshold were designated 
as MCSs. The minimum length of an MCS is 25
bases. Strict cutoffs were used: if even one base fell below the
conservation score threshold, it separated an MCS into two distinct
regions.</P>

<H3>PhastCons-based Elements</H3>
<P>
The predicted MCSs are segments of the alignment that are likely to
have been &quot;generated&quot; by the conserved state of the phylo-HMM,
<em>i.e</em>., maximal segments in which the maximum-likelihood (Viterbi)
path remains in the conserved state.</P>  

<H3>GERP-based Elements</H3>
<P>
GERP elements are scored according to the inferred intensity
of purifying selection
and are measured as &quot;rejected substitutions&quot; (RSs). RSs capture the
magnitude of difference between the number of &quot;observed&quot; substitutions
(estimated using maximum likelihood) and the number that would be
&quot;expected&quot; under a neutral model of evolution.   
The RS is displayed as part of the item name.
The score shown on the details page is based on the RS count, but is
scaled by 300 for display purposes.
<P>
&quot;Constrained elements&quot; are identified as those groups
of consecutive human bases that have an observed rate of evolution that is
smaller than the expected rate.  These groups of columns are merged if they
are less than a few nucleotides apart and are scored according to the sum of
the site-by-site difference between observed and expected rates (RS).</P>
<P>
Permutations of the actual alignments were analyzed, and &quot;constrained
elements&quot identified in these permuted alignments were treated as
&quot;false positives&quot;.  Subsequently, an RS threshold was picked such
that the total length of &quot;false positive&quot;  constrained elements
(identified in the permuted alignments) was less than 5% of the length of
constrained elements identified in the actual alignment.
Thus, all annotated constrained elements are significant at better
than 95% confidence, and the total fraction of the ENCODE regions
annotated as constrained is 5-7%.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
The binCons and phastCons MCS data for this track was generated 
by Elliott Margulies of the Green lab at NHGRI, with assistance 
from Adam Siepel of UCSC. The GERP MCS data were generated by
Greg Cooper in the Sidow lab at Stanford.
