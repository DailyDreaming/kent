<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays multi-species conserved elements (MCSs)
derived from binCons and phastCons conservation scoring
of Threaded Blockset Alignner (TBA) multiple sequence alignments in the 
ENCODE regions.
The multiple sequence alignments are displayed in the TBA Alignments
track and the conservation scoring is shown in the TBA Conservation
track.  The descriptions for these tracks provide details
of the methods used for creating the alignments and conservation.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

The locations of conserved elements are indicated by blocks in the graphical

<P>
For each ENCODE target, a conservation score threshold was picked to match
the number of conserved bases predicted by phastCons, an alternative method
for measuring conservation. This latter method has been found slightly more
reliable for predicting the expected fraction of conserved sequence 
in each target. Clusters of bases
that exceeded the given conservation score threshold were designated 
as MCSs. The minimum length of an MCS is 25
bases. Strict cutoffs were used: if even one base fell below the
conservation score threshold, it separated an MCS into two distinct
regions.</P>

<H3>PhastCons-based Elements</H3>
<P>
The predicted MCSs are segments of the alignment that are likely to
have been &quot;generated&quot; by the conserved state of the phylo-HMM,
<em>i.e</em>., maximal segments in which the maximum-likelihood (Viterbi)
path remains in the conserved state.</P>  

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
The MCS data for this track was generated by Elliott Margulies of the 
Green lab at NHGRI, with assistance from Adam Siepel of UCSC.</P>
