<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
PolyA+ RNA from Retinoic Acid Stimulated HL-60 Cells after 0, 2, 8, and 32 
hours were hybridized to Affymetrix ENCODE oligonucleotide tiling arrays which 
have 25mer probes tiled every 21 bp on average in the non-repeat 
ENCODE regions.
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Transcribed regions were generated by applying a cutoff to the
abundance estimate or 'signal' associated with a 5% false positive 
rate in negative bacterial controls tiled on the array and 
joining probes within 50bp of probes which pass the threshold.  
If the length of a strech of positive probes is less than 50bp, 
they are filtered out.  An estimate of RNA abundance (signal) 
using a Wilcoxon Sign Rank Scan Statistic where the median of 
all pairwise average values of PM-MM is calculated for all probe 
pairs within a sliding window of 101bp of a given central probe 
using quantile normalizing replicate arrays whose median array 
intensity was scaled to 25.  
<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Three independent biological replicates were generated; 
these were used to hybridize 2 arrays (2 technical replicates).
Transcribed regions were generated
from this signal track based on a 5% FP cutoff in negative bacterial
controls. 
These sites were then ranked, individually in each of the replicates, 
based on their log transformed pvalues as computed from the respective 
replicates.  All pairwise differences in these ranks were computed
among biological replicates and replicates were accepted when the sum 
of rank differences was relatively low (there is currently no hard 
cutoff criteria).
