<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track is the collection of all the TransFrags/TARS from
the Yale and Affy transfrags tracks, that are within the
transcript region of Gencode genes, but at least 5000 base
pairs distant from any exon coding region of the Gencode genes.
Thus, these are the TransFrags/TARS within the Gencode introns.
