<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
DNaseI has long been used to map general chromatin accessibility and the DNaseI "hyperaccessibility" or 
"hypersensitivity" that is a universal feature of active cis-regulatory sequences. 

<p>These tracks annotate continous DNaseI sensitivity measurements and DNaseI Hypersensitive Sites 
(HSs) over ENCODE regions produced using Quantitative Chromatin Profiling (QCP) 
Dorschner et al., <a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15782197&query_hl=1'> Nature Methods</a>.&nbsp

<p>In QCP, ~250bp PCR amplicons are tiled end-to-end across study regions, and high-throughput real-time 
PCR is used to quantify DNaseI at each amplicon by measuring copies remaining in DNaseI-treated vs. 
untreated samples.  The results are then analyzed with a statistical algorithm to compute the 
moving baseline of mean DNaseI sensitivity, and to identify outliers that correspond with DNaseI 
hypersensitive sites.

<h4>Cell lines/phenotypes studied</h4>
DNaseI-treated and untreated chromatin samples from the following cell lines/phenotypes were studied:  

<UL>
<LI>GM06990 (lymphoblastoid; all regions)</LI>
<LI>CaCo2 (intestinal; most regions)</LI>
<LI>SK-N-SH (neural; most regions)</LI>
<LI>HepG2 (hepatic; ENm003/Apolipoprotein A1 locus)</LI>
<LI>Huh7 (hepatic; ENm003, ENr131, ENr213, ENr321)</LI>
<LI>K562 (erythroid; ENm009/Beta-globin locus)</LI>
<LI>ERY (CD34-derived primary adult erythroblasts; ENm009/Beta-globin locus)</LI>
</UL>

Two tracks are provided, listing 'odd' and 'even' amplicons.   
Two tracks are utilized so that the amplicons appear visually distinct, and so additional information can be conveyed.  
Clicking on each amplicon reveals its start and stop coordinates, and also its individual raw DNaseI sensitivity score.
The score = [copies in DNaseI-treated/copies in DNaseI-untreated] * 1000.



<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
QCP was performed as described in Dorschner et al.  
An amplicon tiling path has been computed over all regions and is available through 
<a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=unists'>UniSTS</a>.  
Chromatin preparation and DNaseI treatment was performed on the aforementioned cell types as 
described in <a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15782197&query_hl=1'>Dorschner et al. </a>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
QCP measurements are performed in replicate (6X) on pooled biological replicate samples.  
Validation of results was carried out by conventional DNaseI hypersensitivity assays 
using end-labeling/Southern blotting.  A total of 1.17Mb have been evaluated by conventional assay.  
<p>The specificity is defined as the number of true negative evaluable QCP amplicons divided by 
the sum of the true negatives plus false positives.  Using 246.2 kb from ENm002 the specificity 
was calculated to be 0.997. The sensitivity of the QCP assay is calculated as the true positives 
divided by the sum of the true positives plus false negatives.  
The sensitivity measured for ENm002 was 0.9487.
