<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
These tracks summarize results of DNaseI hypersensitivity assays from a series of amplicons 
tiled along a target region performed by high-throughput quantitative PCR.  
This quanitative chromatin profiling (QCP) approach can identify DNaseI hypersensitive 
site core elements and associated cis-regulatory sequences<BR><BR>

<P>
Two tracks are provided, listing 'odd' and 'even' amplicons.   
Two tracks are utilized so that the amplicons appear visually distinct, and so 
additional information can be conveyed.  

Clicking on each amplicon reveals its start and stop coordinates, and also its individual 
DNaseI sensitivity score (= [copies in DNaseI-treated/copies in DNaseI-untreated]*1000).<BR>



<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Primers were designed to amplify contiguous or minimally overlapping ~250 bp 
amplicons across target genomic regions using Primer3.  
Primers were then scanned for repetitive sequences by comparing each to a database of all 
16mers in the human genome.  Amplicons were eliminated from the analysis if 
multiple products were observed in the melting curves.

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
QCP measurements are performed in replicate (6X) on pooled biological replicate samples.  
Validation of results was carried out by conventional DNaseI hypersensitivity assays using 
end-labeling/Southern blotting.  A total of 1.17Mb have been evaluated by conventional assay.  
The specificity is defined as the number of true negative evaluable QCP amplicons divided by 
the sum of the true negatives plus false positives.  Using 246.2 kb from ENm002 the specificity 
was calculated to be 0.997. The sensitivity of the QCP assay is calculated as the true 
positives divided by the sum of the true positives plus false negatives.  The sensitivity 
measured for ENm002 was 0.9487.
