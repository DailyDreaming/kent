<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows allele frequencies for the YRI HapMap population in the 10 ENCODE regions
that have been resequenced for variation.   YRI refers to Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria.

<P>
The score is a function of the minor allele frequency (maf).  
Minor allele frequency varies from 0.0 to .5.
For our score, it is normalized to have minimum 500, maximum 1000.
Precisely: score = 500 + (maf * 1000).   Thus a score of 500 indicates no variation;  
a score of 1000 indicates an even split between 
reference and variant observations in the population.
The display uses a grayscale based on score, where darker is higher.
<P>
