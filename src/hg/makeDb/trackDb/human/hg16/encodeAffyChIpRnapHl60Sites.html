<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
RNA Polymerase II ChIP (treatment) enrichment over Whole Cell Extract 
(control) from Retinoic Acid Stimulated HL-60 Cells after 0, 2, 8, and 32 hours 
were hybridized to Affymetrix ENCODE oligonucleotide tiling arrays which 
have 25mer probes tiled every 21 bp on average in the non-repeat 
ENCODE regions.
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Enriched regions were generated by applying a cutoff of 50 to 
-10log10(p-value) and joining all probes within 500bp of probes 
which pass the threshold.  An estimate of signficance (-10log10(p-value)) 
using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum Scan Statistic where ln(max(PM-MM,1)) is 
calculated for treatment and control for all probe pairs within a 
sliding window of 1001bp of a given central probe using quantile 
normalizing replicate arrays whose median array intensity was scaled to 25.
<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Three independent biological replicates were generated; 
these were used to hybridize 2 arrays (2 technical replicates).
Enriched regions were generated 
from this pval track based on a log transformed pval cutoff of 50. 
These sites were then ranked, individually in each of the replicates, 
based on their log transformed pvalues as computed from the respective 
replicates.  All pairwise differences in these ranks were computed
among biological replicates and replicates were accepted when the sum 
of rank differences was relatively low (there is currently no hard 
cutoff criteria).
