<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays validation data from ChIP/chip experiments on 
four factors in IMR90 cells using a condensed array covering putative
TAF1 binding sites.  The purpose is of the track is to validate 
a whole genome scan which can be viewed in the 
&quot;LI/Ng TAF1 IMR90&quot; (Ludwig Institute, UCSD ChIP/Chip 
(TAF1) genome scan) track.  All four factors - Pol2, H3ac,
H3K4me, and TAF1 itself, are associated with the start of transcribed
genes.  Thus there should be a very strong correlation between the
signals seen in this track and the LI/NG TAF1 IMR90 track.
</P>
<P>
Here is some further information on the four factors.
TAF1 is a component of TFIID, which is itself a 
component of the preinitiation complex which assembles on promoter regions.  
Pol2 is more fully known as RNA Polymerase II, the enzyme responsible
for transcription of mRNA.  The specific antibody against Pol2, 8WG16
from the Abcom catalog, binds specifically to the non-phosphorylated
form of Pol2 which is associated with the preinitiation complex.
h3ac and H3K4me are forms of histone H3 that are associated with
transcriptionally active chromatin.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
For the whole genome scan, 
chromatin from IMR90 cells lines was cross-linked, precipitated with
TAF1 antibody (sc-735, Santa Cruz), sheared, amplified and hybridized
to 38 high-density oligonucleotide arrays (Nimblegen). These arrays
contain a total of 14,535,659 50-mer oligonucleotides, positioned at
every 100 base pairs through the human genome (UCSC hg16).  Using this
set of arrays, a total of 9,966 clusters of TAF1 binding sites were
identified.
The whole genome scan data can be viewed in the &quot;LI/Ng TAF1 IMR90&quot; 
(Ludwig Institute, UCSD ChIP/Chip (TAF1) genome scan)
track.

<P>
To verify the binding of TAF1 to these sequences, we designed a
condensed array that contained a total of 379,521 oligonucleotides to
represent the 9,966 putative TAF1 binding sequences plus 29 control
genomic loci, from the 44 ENCODE6 regions, at 100 bp resolution.  Using
these condensed arrays, two independent chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) experiments were performed with the antibodies against TAF1, RNA 
polymerase II, acetylated histone 3 and dimethylated K4 histone 3.  A
total of 8,597 TAF1 binding regions, ranging in size from 400 bp to 9.8
Kbp, were confirmed by the TAF1 replicate experiments.

The raw data have been deposited in

after the paper published.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
The peaks from genome scan experiments were verified using condensed
arrays, as described in the Methods section.
