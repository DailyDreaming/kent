<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays validation data from ChIP/chip experiments on 
4 factors using a condensed array, validating a whole genome scan 
which can be viewed in the &quot;ChIP/LI TAF1 Ng&quot; 
(Ludwig Institute, UCSD ChIP/Chip (TAF1) genome scan)
track.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
For the whole genome scan, 
chromatin from IMR90 cells lines was cross-linked, precipitated with
TAF1 antibody (sc-735, Santa Cruz), sheared, amplified and hybridized
to 38 high-density oligonucleotide arrays (Nimblegen). These arrays
contain a total of 14,535,659 50-mer oligonucleotides, positioned at
every 100 base pairs through the human genome (UCSC hg16).  Using this
set of arrays, a total of 9,966 clusters of TFIID binding sites were
identified.
The whole genome scan data can be viewed in the &quot;ChIP/LI TAF1 Ng&quot; 
(Ludwig Institute, UCSD ChIP/Chip (TAF1) genome scan)
track.
</P>
<P>
To verify the binding of TFIID to these sequences, we designed a
condensed array that contained a total of 379,521 oligonucleotides to
represent the 9,966 putative TFIID binding sequences plus 29 control
genomic loci, from the 44 ENCODE6 regions, at 100 bp resolution.  Using
these condensed arrays, two independent chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) experiments were performed with the antibodies against TAF1, RNA 
polymerase II, acetylated histone 3 and dimethylated K4 histone 3.  A
total of 8,597 TFIID binding regions, ranging in size from 400 bp to 9.8
Kbp, were confirmed by the TAF1 replicate experiments.

The raw data have been deposited in 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=geo" 
TARGET=_BLANK>GEO</A> (GSE2672) and will be released 
after the paper published.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
The peaks from genome scan experiments were verified using condensed
arrays, as described in the Methods section.
