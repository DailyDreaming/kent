<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Each of these four tracks shows the map of signal intensity 
(estimating the fold enrichment [log2 scale] of ChIP DNA vs 
unstimulated DNA) for STAT1 ChIP-chip using Human Hela S3 cells 
hybridized to four different array designs/platforms. The first 
three platforms are custom maskless photolithographic arrays 
with oligonucleotides tiling most of the non-repetitive DNA 
sequence of the ENCODE regions. The first maskless design uses 
50 mer oligonucleotides tiled every 38 bps (overlapping by 12 
nts), the second maskless design uses 36 mer oligonucleotides 
tiled end to end, and the third uses 50 mer oligonucleotides 
tiled end to end. The fourth array platform is an ENCODE PCR 
Amplicon array manufactured by Bing Rens lab at UCSD. Each track 
shows the combined results of multiple biological replicates: 5 
for the first maskless array (50 mer every 38 bp), 2 for the 
second maskless array (36 mer every 36 bp), 3 for the third 
maskless array (50 mer every 50 bp) and 6 for the PCR Amplicon 
array. For all array the STAT1 ChIP DNA was labeled with Cy5 and 
the control DNA was labeled with Cy3. See NCBI GEO <a 
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=
GSE2714">GSE2714</a> for details of experimental protocols.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
For Maskless Photolithographic Arrays:
The data from replicates were median scaled and quantile 
normalized to each other (both Cy3 and Cy5 channels). Using a 
501 bp sliding window centered on each oligonucleotide probe a 
signal map (estimating the fold enrichment [log<sub>2</sub> 
scale] of ChIP DNA) is generated by computing the pseudomedian 
signal of all log<sub>2</sub>(Cy5/Cy3) ratios (median of 
pairwise averages) within the window (including replicates). 
Using the same procedure a -log<sub>10</sub>(p-value) map 
(measuring significance of enrichment of oligonucleotide probes 
in the window) for all sliding windows can be made by computing 
p-values using the Wilcoxon paired signed rank test comparing 
fluorensent intensity between Cy5 and Cy3 for each 
oligonucleotide probe (Cy5 and Cy3 signals from the same array). 
A binding site is determined by thresholding both on fold 
enrichment and -log<sub>10</sub>(p-value) and requiring a 
maximum gap and a minimum run between oligonucleotide positions.

For the first maskless array (50 mer every 38 bp):
<BR> 
log<sub>2</sub>(Cy5/Cy3) &gt;= 1.25,-log<sub>10</sub>(p-value) &gt;= 
8.0, MaxGap &lt;= 100 bp, MinRun &gt;= 180 bp; 
<BR>
the second maskless array (36 mer every 36 bp): 
<BR>
log<sub>2</sub>(Cy5/Cy3) &gt;= 0.25, -log<sub>10</sub>(p-value) &gt;= 
4.0, MaxGap &lt;= 250 bp, MinRun &gt;= 0 bp; 
<BR>
the third maskless array (50 mer every 50 bp): 
<BR>
log<sub>2</sub>(Cy5/Cy3) &gt;= 0.25, -log<sub>10</sub>(p-value) &gt;= 
4.0, MaxGap &lt;= 250 bp, MinRun &gt;= 0 bp. 
<BR><BR>
For PCR Amplicon Arrays:
The Cy5 and Cy3 array data are loess normalized between channels 
on the same slide and then between slides. A z-score is then 
determined for each PCR amplicon from the distribution of 
log(Cy5/Cy3) in a local log(Cy5*Cy3) intensity window (see 
Quackenbush and <a href 
="http://array.mbb.yale.edu/analysis/">Express Yourself</a> for 
more details). From the z-score a p-value is then associated 
with each PCR amplicon. Hits are determined using a 3 sigma 
threshold and requiring a spot to be present on 3 out of 6 
arrays.

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
ChIP-chip binding sites are verified by comparing "hit lists" 
generated from combinations of different biological replicates. 
Only experiments which yield a significant overlap (greater than 
50 percent) are accepted. As an independent check (for maskless 
arrays) data on the microarray are randomized with respect to 
position and re-scored; significantly fewer hits (consistent 
with random noise) are generated this way.

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
This data was generated and analyzed by the labs of Michael 
Snyder, Mark Gerstein and Sherman Weissman at Yale. The PCR 
Amplicon arrays were manufactured by Bing Ren's lab at UCSD.
