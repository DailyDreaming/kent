is described in
<A HREF="http://www.genome.gov/10005107" TARGET=_BLANK>The ENCODE Project: ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements</A>.
<p>
There are 44 ENCODE regions, comprising 1% of the human genome.
These regions were selected for intensive study to identify, locate and analyze all functional elements in the region. For a description of how the
regions were selected, see
