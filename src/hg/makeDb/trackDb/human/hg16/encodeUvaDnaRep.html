<H2> Description </H2>
<P>
The five subtracks in this annotation correspond to five different time points
relative to the start of the DNA synthesis phase (S-phase)
of the cell cycle.  Regions that are replicated during the
given time interval are shown in green.  Varying shades
of green are used to distinguish one subtrack from another.

<H2> Methods </H2>
<P>
The experimental strategy adopted to map this 
profile involved isolation of replication products from HeLa cells 
synchronized at the G1-S boundary by thymidine-aphidicolin double block 
and released from the block followed by BrdU 
labeling at every two-hour interval of the 10 hours of the S-phase. 
The heavy-light DNA representing the pool of DNA replicated during 
each two-hour labeling period was purified by double cesium chloride 
density gradient centrifugation and hybridized to a high-density 
genome-tiling Affymetrix array comprised of all unique probes within the 
ENCODE regions. 
<P>
The raw data generated through the microarray experiments was 
processed by computing the enrichment of signal in a particular 
part of the S-phase relative to the entirety of the S-phase (10 hours).
High confidence (p-value = 1E5) regions of 
replication were mapped by applying the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test in a sliding
window of size 10 kb using the standard Affymetrix data analyses tools
and the April 2003 version of the human genome assembly. 
These coordinates were then mapped to the July 2003 assembly by UCSC,
using the liftOver tool.

<H2> Verification </H2>
<P>
The submitted data are from two biological experimental sets.  Regions of
significant enrichment were included from both of the biological replicates.
