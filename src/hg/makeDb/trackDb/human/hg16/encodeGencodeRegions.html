<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
These four tracks represent the classification of regions near the Gencode
reference genes into proximal and distal, intronic and intergenic areas.
Distal areas are more than 5000 base pairs distant from the specified
region.  Proximal areas are no more than 5000 base pairs distant from
the specified region.  Intronic regions are those areas between exons of
the reference Gencode gene set.  Intergenic regions are those areas outside
of all Gencode gene extents.  A gene extent is defined by its transcript
start and transcript end locations.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
This data was collected directly from the UCSC Genome
browser via the Table Browser.

<P>
The Gencode reference gene set are the genes of types:
<em>Known</em>, <em>Novel_CDS</em>, <em>Novel_transcript_gencode_conf</em>,
and <em>Putative_gencode_conf</em>.  The exons of this gene set were
extracted via the table browser to define the intronic regions.
The transcript start and stop coordinates of this gene set were extracted
via the table browser to define the intergenic regions.  There is some
fuzziness to these classifications due to isoforms and overlapping
transcripts.
