<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Genome-wide location analysis of histone H3 trimethyl lysine 4 (H3K4me3)
was conducted employing ChIP/chip using chromatin extracted from GM06990 (lymphoblastoid) cells.

<H2>METHODS</H2>

Chromatin from the cell line was cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, precipitated with 
antibody binding to histone H3 trimethyl lysine 4, sheared and hybridized to a DNA array.  
DNA was not amplified prior to hybridization.
                                   
The raw and transformed data files reflect fold enrichment over background, averaged over
six replicates.

<H2>VERIFICATION</H2>
                      
There are six replicates total: two technical replicates (chromatin preparations) for each of the 
three biological replicates (cell cultures).

Raw and transformed (averaged) data can be downloaded from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute
