<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
DNaseI-hypersensitive sites were cloned from primary human CD4+ T-cells and
sequenced using massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS; 
Brenner et al., 2000; Crawford and Collins, unpublished data).  Only 
clusters of multiple DNaseI library sequences that map within 500 
bases of each other are displayed (DNase HS).  A real-time PCR assay has
determined that clusters are 90% accurate at identifying valid 
DNaseI-hypersensitive sites (McArthur et al., 2001; Crawford et al., 
2004).  Each cluster has been assigned a unique identifier; the last 
digit of each identifier represents the number of sequences that 
mapped within that particular cluster.

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Data were considered verified when both of the following conditions were met:
<UL>
<LI>
Multiple sequences from the DNase library cluster within 500 bases of 
each other (random in-silico libraries show very little clustering).
<LI>
At least 90% of these clustered regions are hypersensitive by real-time PCR.
</UL>
