<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
DNAseI hypersensitive sites were cloned from primary human CD4+ T-cells and
sequenced using massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS; 
Brenner et al., 2000; Crawford and Collins, unpublished data).  Only 
clusters of multiple DNAse I library sequences that map within 500 
bases of each other are displayed (DNAse HS).  Clusters were found to 
be 90% accurate at identifying valid DNAse hypersensitive sites by 
using a real-time PCR assay (McArthur et al., 2001; Crawford et al., 
2004).  Each cluster was given a unique identifier, and the last 
digit of each identifier represents the number of sequences that 
mapped within that particular cluster.

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Data was considered verified by two criteria:
<P>
1) when multiple sequences from our DNAse library cluster within 500 bases of each other (random in silico libraries show very little clustering) 
<P>
2) at least 90% of these clustered regions are hypersensitive by real-time PCR.
