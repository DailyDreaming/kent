<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Chromatin IP was performed as previously described (Trinklein <em>et
al</em>. 2004).  Amplified and labeled ChIP DNA was hybridized to
oligo tiling arrays produced by Nimblegen along with a total genomic
reference sample.  The data for each array were median subtracted (log
2 ratios) and normalized (divided by the standard deviation).</P>
<P>
The transformed mean ratios of ChIP DNA:Total DNA for 
all probes were then smoothed by calculating a sliding-window mean.  
Windows of 6 neighboring probes (sliding 2 probes at a time) were 
used; within each window, the highest and lowest value were dropped, 
and the remaining 4 values were averaged.  In order to increase the 
contrast between high and low values for visual display, the average 
was converted to a score by this formula: <BR>
score = 8^(average) * 10<BR>
These scores are for visualization purposes; for all analyses, 
the raw ratios should be used.  Those ratios are available in the 
"Stanf ChIP" track.

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Three biological replicates and two technical replicates were
performed.  The Myers lab is currently testing the specificity and
sensitivity using real-time PCR.</P>
