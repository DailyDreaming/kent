<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays
a set of human-centric multiple alignments of the sequencies included
in the <A
HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg16/encode/alignments/MAY-2005/">
May 2005 ENCODE freeze</A>, generated by <A HREF="http://lagan.stanford.edu/">MLAGAN</A>.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The alignments were created in the following way:
<UL>
<LI>First, the sequence of each other species is &quot;rearranged&quot; so that it is orthologously collinear with
respect to the human sequence. This is done with a suite of tools and algorithms, based on Shuffle-LAGAN and SuperMap.
For every pair of &lt;human, other species&gt;, Shuffle-LAGAN is used to find the best-scoring chain of local
similarities (according to some scoring scheme that penalizes evolutionary rearrangements), and then SuperMap is used
to aggregate parts of the chain into a human-monotonic map of syntenic blocks. This mapping is used to undo the
genomic rearrangements of the other sequence and convert it to a form that is directly alignable to the human sequence.</LI>
<LI>Then, a multiple global alignment is created for every region using <a href="http://lagan.stanford.edu/">MLAGAN</A>.</LI>
<LI>Finally, the alignments are refined using <A HREF="http://www.drive5.com/muscle/">MUSCLE</A>. MUSCLE processes small
non-overlapping windows of the alignment and attempts to realign them in an iterative fashion, keeping the refined alignment
if it has a better sum-of-pairs score than the original.</LI>
