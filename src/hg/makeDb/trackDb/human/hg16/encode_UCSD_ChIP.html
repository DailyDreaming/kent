A PCR tiling array composed of 24537 non-repetitive sequences within the the 44 
ENCODE regions was manufactured by the Ren lab at UCSD. Genome-wide location 
analyses of TAF1 binding and RNA polymerase II binding were conducted using 
chromatin extracted from IMR90, HCT116, HeLa and THP1 cells. 
<P>
There are three replicates for each of the eight experiments.  
The P-value were generated using the weighted average 
(methods described in Li Z et al. (2003)  
PNAS, 100:8184-8169) results of the corresponding three replicates.
The scale is 0-16, corresponding to -log base 10.
