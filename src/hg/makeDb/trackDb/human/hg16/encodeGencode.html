<p>
This track shows high-quality manual annotations as well as experimental gene structure validations generated within the <a href="http://genome.imim.es/gencode/">GENCODE project</a>.<br>
</p><h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
<u><a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/HGP/havana/">HAVANA</a> manual annotations</u>:<br>
Finished genomic sequence is analysed on a clone by clone basis using a
combination of similarity searches against DNA and protein databases as
well as a series of <i>ab initio</i>
gene predictions. Nucleotide sequence databases are searched with
WUBLASTN (http://blast.wustl.edu), and significant hits are re-aligned
to the unmasked genomic sequence by EST2GENOME. The Uniprot protein
database (http://www.uniprot.org) is searched with WUBLASTX, and the
accession numbers of significant hits are looked up in the Pfam
database . The hidden Markov models for Pfam protein domains are
aligned against the genomic sequence using Genewise , to provide
annotation of protein domains. We also run a number of <i>ab initio</i>
prediction algorithms: Genscan and Fgenesh for genes, tRNAscan to find
tRNA genes, and Eponine TSS which predicts transcription start sites.
The annotators use the (AceDB-based) Otterlace interface to create and
edit gene objects, which are then stored in a local database named <i>Otter</i>.
Where predicted transcript structures from Ensembl are available these
can be viewed from within the otterlace interface and may be used as
starting templates for gene curation. Annotation in the Otter database
is submitted to the EMBL/Genbank/DDBJ nucleotide database.

</p><h2>Verification</h2>
<p>Gene objects selected for verification come from various
computational prediction methods and HAVANA annotations. RT-PCR and
RACE experiments were performed on them, using a variety of human
tissues, to confirm their structure. Human cDNAs from 24 different
tissues (brain, heart, kidney, spleen, liver, colon, small intestine,
muscle, lung, stomach, testis, placenta, skin, peripheral blood
leucocytes, bone marrow, fetal brain, fetal liver, fetal kidney, fetal
heart, fetal lung, thymus, pancreas, mammary gland, prostate) were
synthesized using 12 poly(A)+ RNAs from Origene, 8 from Clemente
Associates/Quantum Magnetics and 4 from BD Biosciences as described in
[Reymond et al., 2002, Nature; Reymond et al., 2002, Genomics]. The
relative amount of each cDNA was normalized by quantitative PCR using
SyberGreen as intercalator and an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection
System.
Predictions of human genes junctions were assayed experimentally by
RT-PCR as previously described and modified [Reymond, 2002 Genomics,
Waterston, 2002, Nature, Guigo, 2003 PNAS]. Similar amounts of Homo
sapiens cDNAs were mixed with JumpStart REDTaq ReadyMix (Sigma) and 4
ng/ul primers (Sigma-Genosys) with a BioMek 2000 robot (Beckman). The
ten first cycles of PCR amplification were performed with a touchdown
annealing temperatures decreasing from 60 to 50ºC; annealing
temperature of the next 30 cycles was carried out at 50ºC. Amplimers
were separated on "Ready to Run" precast gels (Pharmacia) and
sequenced. RACE experiments were performed with the BD SMART RACE cDNA
Amplification Kit following the manufacturer instructions (BD
Biosciences).
