<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows depth sequencing coverage for the four HapMap populations in the 
ten ENCODE regions that have been resequenced for variation. The data for
each population is shown in a separate subtrack:
<UL>
<LI>HapMap Allele Frequencies (CEU): Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe
<LI>HapMap Allele Frequencies (CHB): Han Chinese in Beijing, China
<LI>HapMap Allele Frequencies (JPT): Japanese in Tokyo, Japan
<LI>HapMap Allele Frequencies (YRI): Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria
</UL></P>
<P>
The ENCODE regions targeted in this annotation include: 
<UL>
<LI>ENr112 (chr2)
<LI>ENr131 (chr2)
<LI>ENr113 (chr4)
<LI>ENm010 (chr7)
<LI>ENm013 (chr7)
<LI>ENm014 (chr7)
<LI>ENr321 (chr8)
<LI>ENr232 (chr9)
<LI>ENr123 (chr12)
<LI>ENr213 (chr18)
</UL></P>
