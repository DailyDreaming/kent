<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the FWD (+) and REV (-) strand transcript map of intensity
scores (estimating RNA abundance) for Human Placental Poly(A)+ RNA hybridized 
to the Yale MAS (Maskless Array Synthesizer) ENCODE oligonucleotide 
microarray, transcription mapping design #1. This array has 36-mer 
oligonucleotide probes approximately every 36 bp (<i>i.e.</i>, 
end-to-end) covering all the non-repetitive DNA sequence of the ENCODE 
regions ENm001-ENm012. See NCBI
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL2105"
    TARGET=_blank>GEO GPL2105</A> for details of this array design. 

This transcript map is a combined signal from 3 biological replicates, each
with at least 2 technical replicates. Arrays were hybridized using the
protocol used in Bertone et al (2004).

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
A score is assigned to each oligonucleotide probe position by combining 
two or more technical replicates and by using a sliding window 
approach. Within a sliding window of 160 bp (corresponding to 5 
oligos), the hybridization intensities for all replicates of each 
oligonucleotide probe are compared to their respective array median 
score. Within the window and across all the replicates, the number of 
probes above and below their respective median are counted. Using the 
sign test, a one-sided p-value is then calculated and a score defined 
as score=-log(<i>p-value</i>) is assigned to the oligo in the center of 
the window.

Three independent biological replicates were generated and each was 
hybridized to at least 2 different arrays (technical replicates).

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Reasonable correlation coefficients between replicates are ensured. 
Additionally, transcribed regions (TARs/transfrags) are called and 
compared between technical and biological replicate to ensure 
significant overlap.

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
This data was generated and analyzed by the the labs of Michael Snyder, 
Mark Gerstein and Sherman Weissman at Yale.
