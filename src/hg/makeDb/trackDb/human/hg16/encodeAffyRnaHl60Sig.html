<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
PolyA+ RNA from Retinoic Acid Stimulated HL-60 Cells after 0, 2, 8, or 32 hours 
were hybridized to Affymetrix ENCODE oligonucleotide tiling arrays which 
have 25mer probes tiled every 21 bp on average in the non-repeat 
ENCODE regions.
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
An estimate of RNA abundance (signal) using a Wilcoxon Sign Rank Scan Statistic 
where the median of all pairwise average values of PM-MM is calculated 
for all probe pairs within a sliding window of 101bp of a given central
probe using quantile normalizing replicate arrays whose median array 
intensity was scaled to 25.  
<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Three independent biological replicates were generated; 
these were used to hybridize 2 arrays (2 technical replicates).
Transcribed regions were generated
from this signal track based on a 5% FP cutoff in negative bacterial
controls.
These sites were then ranked, individually in each of the replicates, 
based on their signal as computed from the respective 
replicates.  All pairwise differences in these ranks were computed
among biological replicates and replicates were accepted when the sum 
of rank differences was relatively low (there is currently no hard 
cutoff criteria).
