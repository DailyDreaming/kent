<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The H-Invitational Genes CDNA track shows alignments of full-length CDNA's
which were used as the basis of the 
<A HREF="http://www.jbirc.aist.go.jp/hinv/top.html" TARGET=_blank> H-Invitational Gene Database </A> (HInv-DB).  
The HInv-DB is a human gene database, with human-curated annotation of 41,118 full-length cDNA clones, representing 21,037 cDNA clusters.
The project was initiated in 2002, and the database was made publically
available in April 2004.
</P>
<P>
HInv-DB entries describe gene structures, functions, novel alternative splicing isoforms, non-coding functional RNAs, functional domains, sub-cellular localizations, metabolic pathways, predictions of protein 3D structure, mapping of SNPs and microsatellite repeat motifs in relation with orphan diseases, gene expression profiling, and comparative results with mouse full-length cDNAs gene structures.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
To cluster redundant cDNAs and alternative splicing variants within the H-Inv 
cDNAs, the total of 41,118 H-Inv cDNAs were mapped to the human genome using 
the mapping pipeline developed by JBIRC, yielding 40,140 cDNAs that were 
aligned with the stringent criteria of at least 95% identity and 90% length 
coverage against the genome. These 40,140 cDNAs were clustered to 20,190 loci, 
resulting in an average of 2.0 cDNAs per locus. For the remaining 978 unmapped 
cDNAs, cDNA-based clustering was applied, yielding 847 clusters. 
In total, 21,037 clusters (20,190 mapped and 847 unmapped) were identified 
and integrated into H-InvDB. H-Inv cluster IDs (e.g. HIX0000001) were
assigned  to these clusters. A representative sequence was selected from each 
cluster and used for further analyses and annotation.

The H-InvDB is hosted at the Japan Biological Information Research 
Center (JBIRC).
The human-curated annotations were produced during invitational annotation
meetings held in Japan during the summer of 2002, with a follow-on
meeting in November 2004.  Participants included 158 scientists 
representing 67 institutions from 12 countries.

The full-length CDNA clones and sequences were produced by the
Chinese National Human Genome Center (CHGC), 
the Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ/MIPS), 
Helix Research Institute, Inc. (HRI), 
the Institute of Medical Science in the University of Tokyo (IMSUT), 
the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (KDRI), 
the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC/NIH) and then
"Full-Length Long Japan" (FLJ) project.
