<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.  Most of these gaps - with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic, centromeric, telomeric, and short-arm 
gaps - have been closed during the finishing process, although a small number still remain. 
</P><P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is known, it is a <em>bridged</em> gap. In this case, a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap, and the gap label contains the word &quot;yes&quot;. 
</P>
<P>There are 7 types of gaps:
<UL>
<LI><B>Fragment</B> - gaps between the contigs of a draft clone (size varies). 
(In this context, a contig is a set of overlapping sequence reads.)
 
<LI><B>Clone</B> - gaps between clones in the same map contig (size varies).  
<LI><B>Contig</B> - gaps between map contigs (size varies). 
<LI><B>Heterochromatin</B> - gaps from large blocks of heterochromatin (size varies).
<LI><B>Centromere</B> - gaps from centromeres (3,000,000 N's). 
<LI><B>Short-arm</B> - large gaps in the short (p) arm (size varies). 
<LI><B>Telomere</B> - gaps from telomeres (size varies).
</UL></P>
