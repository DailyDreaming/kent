<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays smoothed (sliding-window mean) scores for 
experimentally determined regions of unmethylated
CpGs in the ENCODE regions.  These experiments were performed in 8
cell lines, each of which is displayed as a separate subtrack:

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
High molecular weight genomic DNA was prepared from each cell line.
The genomic DNA was digested with a cocktail of 6 methyl-sensitive
restriction enzymes (AciI, HhaI, BstUI, HpaII, HgaI, and HpyCH4IV) and
size selected to deplete the genome of unmethylated regions.  Digested
and undigested DNA (control) were amplified, labeled, and hybridized
to oligo tiling arrays produced by Nimblegen.  The data for each array
were median subtracted (log 2 ratios) and normalized (divided by the 
standard deviation).</P>
<P>
The transformed mean ratios of undigested:digested genomic DNA for 
all probes were then smoothed by calculating a sliding-window mean.  
Windows of 6 neighboring probes (sliding 2 probes at a time) were 
used; within each window, the highest and lowest value were dropped, 
and the remaining 4 values were averaged.  In order to increase the 
contrast between high and low values for visual display, the average 
was converted to a score by this formula: <BR>
score = 8^(average) * 10<BR>
These scores are for visualization purposes; for all analyses, 
the raw ratios should be used.  Those ratios are available in the 
"Stanf Meth" track.  
</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Three biological replicates and 2 technical replicates were done for
each of the 8 cell lines.  
The Myers lab is currently testing the specificity and sensitivity using 
real-time PCR.
