<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Deletion/Insertion Polymorphisms are shown at their genomic location with the variant allele displayed as 
detected from the identified trace name. 
<P>
The quality value is the minimum phred quality value over the entire range of the DIP within the trace.
<P>
The location of the DIP is its 3' position within the trace.  The alleles are reported relative to 
the + strand of the reference sequence, however, the trace may actually align to the - strand. 
Strand is reported, and when viewing the chromatogram using the URL provided, if the trace aligned 
to the - strand the DIP bases in the trace will be the reverse compliment of the variant allele given.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>

All human trace data from NCBI's trace archive was aligned to hg17 with ssahaSNP followed by 
ssahaDIP post processing to detect deletion/insertion polymorphisms. DIPs within ENCODE regions 
were extracted and 40 of 44 regions were translated to hg16 coordinates.

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
For verification, 500k traces from the mouse WGS sequencing effort
(ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/TraceDB/mus_musculus/fasta.mus_musculus.045.gz), 
were compared to mm6 using ssahaSNP and ssahaDIP.

Since mm6 and these traces are all from the same mouse strain, C57BL/6J, the DIP rate 
should be very low.  Applying a quality threshold of Q23, the detected DIP rate was 1 DIP per 
140k Neighborhood Quality Standard (NQS) bases.  This level was 10 fold lower
than the SNP rate for the same data set using ssahaSNP, which has been validated 
as having a 5% FP rate. 
The detected DIP rate for human traces against hg17 us 1 DIP per 12k NQS bases, 
indicating a FP rate of 12k/140k, or about 8%. 
<P>
Further validation experiments are in progress.
