<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows paired end ditag (PET) sequences mapped to the
genome.  Full-length transcripts derived from two cell lines 
were represented by the PET sequences: 
<UL>
<LI>the log phase of MCF7 cells</LI>
<LI>HCT116 cells treated with 5FU for 6 hours</LI>
</UL>
In total, 584624 PETs were generated for MCF7 and 280340 PETs were
generated for HCT116, and more than 80% of PETs in each group were 
mapped to the genome.
The 474278 MCF7 PETs and 223261 HCT116 PETs mapped with single and
multiple (up to 10) matches in the genome are shown in the two 
subtracks of this track.
</P>
<P> 
In the graphical display, PET sequences are shown as two blocks
representing the ends of the pair, connected by a thin arrowed
line. The arrows indicate the orientation of transcription
direction. Each PET sequence has an ID followed by some descriptive
numbers, like this: XXXXX-N-M.  Where the X is the unique ID for each
PET, N indicates the number of mapping locations in the genome (1 for
single mapping location, 2 for two mapping location, and so forth),
and the M is the count of this PET measured. The total count of PET
sequences mapped to the same loci but with slight nucleotide
difference may reflect the expression level of the transcripts.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
PolyA+ RNA was isolated from the cells. A full-length cDNA library was
constructed and further converted into a PET library for Gene
Identification Signature analysis (Ng et al, 2005, Nature Methods
2:105). Each PET sequence contains an 18 bp from the 5' end and an 18
bp from the 3' end of the original full-length cDNA clone. The 18 bp
3' signature contains 16 bp 3' specific nucleotides and an AA residual
of the polyA tail as the indicator of sequence orientation.  The
following specific mapping criteria were used:
<UL>
<LI> a minimal continues 16 bp match must exist for the 5' signature and a 
     minimal continues 14 bp for the 3'signature</LI>
<LI> both 5' and 3' signatures must be present on the same chromosome</LI>
<LI> the 5' to 3' orientation must be correct</LI>
<LI> the maximal genomic span of a PET genomic alignment must be within 
     1 million bp. </LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
Most of the PET sequences (>90%) are mapped to specific locations
(single mapping loci). PETs mapped to multiple locations up to 10 are
also included, which may represent duplicated genes or pseudogenes in
the genome.
</P> 
<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
To assess overall PET quality and mapping specificity, we first
examined the top 10 most abundant PET clusters that mapped to
well-characterized known genes. Over 99% of PETs represented
full-length transcripts, and the majority fell within 10 bp of the
known 5' and 3' boundaries of these transcripts.  We further verified
the PET mapping by confirming the existence of physical cDNA clones
represented by the ditags. We designed PCR primers based on the PET
sequences, amplified the corresponding cDNA inserts from the parental
GIS flcDNA library for sequencing analysis. In a set of 86
arbitrarily-selected PETs representing a wide range of annotation
categories, including known genes (38 PETs), predicted genes (2 PETs),
and novel transcripts (46 PETs) examined, 84 (97.7%) were confirmed
the existence of bona fide transcripts.

The GIS-PET libraries and sequence data for transcriptome analysis
were produced at the Genome Institute of Singapore. The data were
mapped and analyzed by scientists from the Genome Institute of
Singapore and the Bioinformatics Institute, Singapore.
