<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays human tissue microarray data using
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/products/arrays/specific/exon.affx" 
TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0</A> GeneChip.
The track was produced as part of the ENCODE Project.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The display for this track shows probe location and signal value
as grayscale-colored items where higher
signal values correspond to darker-colored blocks.  Items with score of 1000
are in the highest 10% quantile for signal value of that particular cell type.
Similarly, items scoring 900 are the next 10% quantile and at the bottom of
scale, items scoring 100 are in the lowest 10% quantile for signal value.
</P>
<P>The subtracks within this composite annotation track correspond to data from 
different cell types and tissues.  The configuration options are 
shown at the top of the track description page, followed by a list of 
subtracks. 
To display only selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you 
wish to hide.
<P>

<B>Affy Exon</B> supertrack in the &quot;Expression&quot; track group.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Cells were grown according to the approved 
<A HREF="../../ENCODE/protocols/cell" TARGET=_BLANK>ENCODE cell culture protocols</A>.
A subset of the cells was stored frozen in RNALater.  Total RNA was labeled and
hybridized to Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays.  Exon and gene level
expression analysis were carried out using Affymetrix ExACT 1.2.1 and Affymetrix
Expression Console 1.1 software tools. Samples were quantile normalized for
background correction and Probe Logarithmic Intensity Error summarized.

<H3>Verification</H3>
<P>
Data were verified by sequencing biological replicates displaying correlation
coefficient >0.9.
