<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track contains Venter's SNPs.  An overview is given 
<A HREF="http://www.jcvi.org/cms/research/projects/huref/overview/" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The alleles in the the details page are what is found on the plus strand.  
What is shown in the browser adjusts to the requested view, complementing 
and or reversing the nucleotides as needed.  
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
This track contains Venter's SNPs from the file HuRef.InternalHuRef-NCBI.gff.
This was filtered for method 1 SNPs only, and any SNPs that had N as an allele
were also filtered out.
</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
