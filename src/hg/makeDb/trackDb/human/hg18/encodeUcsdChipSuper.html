<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
This super track groups related tracks from Ludwig Institute/UCSD ChIP-chip 
experiments.
These tracks contain ChIP-chip data for transcription initiation
complex and H3, H4 histones in 4 cell lines.
</P>
<P>
The initiation-complex form of Pol2 is associated with the transcription
start site, as is TAF1.
TAF1, a protein found at the start of transcribed genes, is a general
transcription factor that is a key part of the pre-initiation complex found
on the promoter.  It is more fully known as TBP-associated factor 1 of the
TFIID complex or by its molecular weight as TAF250.<br>
The H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3ac form of histone H3, and H4ac form of
histone H4 are associated with up-regulation of gene expression. 
STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) binds to DNA and 
activates
transcription in response to various cytokines, including interferon-gamma. </P>

<H3>LI ChIP</H3>
<P>
Factors: RNA polymerase II (Pol2),
TATA-associated factor (TAF1),
acetylated histone H3 (H3ac),
lysine-4-dimethylated H3 (H3K4me2),
suppressor of zeste 12 protein homolog (SUZ12), and
lysine-27-tri-methylated H3 (H3K27me3). <br>
Cell lines:
IMR90 (lung fibroblast),
HCT116 (colon epithelial carcinoma),
HeLa (cervix epithelial adenocarcinoma), and
THP1 (blood monocyte leukemia) cells.<br>
</P>

<H3>LI gIF ChIP</H3>
<P>
Factors: histones H3 and H4 with antibodies
H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3ac, H4ac, STAT1, RNA polymerase II and TAF1 <br>
Cell line: HeLa cells induced for 30 min with interferon-gamma as well as uninduced cells. <br>
</P>

<H3>LI Ng TAF1 IMR90</H3>
<P>
Factor: TAF1 <br>
Cell line: fibroblastoid (IMR90) cells <br>
</P>

<H3>LI Ng gIF ChIP</H3>
<P>
Factors: H3 (H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3ac), H4 (H4ac), STAT1, RNA Pol2 <br>
Cell line: HeLa <br>
Treatment: 30 minutes after gamma interferon (and uninduced)
</P>

<H3>LI Ng Validation</H3>
<P>
This track displays validation data from ChIP-chip experiments on
four factors in IMR90 cells using a condensed array covering putative
TAF1 binding sites.  This track may be used to validate the whole genome
scan shown in the LI/Ng TAF1 IMR90 track (Ludwig Institute, UCSD ChIP-chip
(TAF1) genome scan).  All four factors &mdash; Pol2, H3ac,
H3K4me2, and TAF1 itself &mdash; are associated with the start of transcribed
genes.  Thus, there should be a very strong correlation between the
signals shown in this track and the LI/NG TAF1 IMR90 track.</P>
