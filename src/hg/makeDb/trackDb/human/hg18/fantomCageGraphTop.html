<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows 5' cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) tags and clusters from 
FANTOM Consortium and the Riken Omics Science Center in 
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=rnaExtract">RNA extracts</A> 
from different timepoints during the differentiations of human cell line THP-1.

A CAGE cluster is a region of overlapping tags with an assigned value
that represents the expression level.  

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track is a multi-view composite track that contains multiple data types
(<EM>views</EM>).  For each view, there are multiple subtracks that
display individually on the browser.  Instructions for configuring multi-view
tracks are 
<A HREF="../../goldenPath/help/multiView.html" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.
To show only selected views, uncheck the boxes next to the ones that 
you wish to hide.
This track contains the following views:
<DL>
<DT><I>Plus</I> and <I>Minus</I> <I>Clusters</I>
<DD>These views display clusters of overlapping read mappings on the
forward and reverse genomic strands.
<DT><i>Reads</i>
<DD>The alignments view shows the individual tags (read mappings). Each tag is named with the
timepoint that it was discovered during. Different timepoints can be excluded or highlighted using
the filters. For example typing "H04" in the box and selecting "include" will only display tags from
the hour 4 timepoint.
