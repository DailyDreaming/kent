<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This super track groups related tracks from Uppsala University, Sweden ChIP-chip experiments.
These tracks contain ChIP-chip data for transcription factors and acetylated histone H3 (H3ac) and H4 (H4ac) in
HepG2 cell line.
</P>
<P>
1) Uppsala ChIP <br>
This track displays the results of ENCODE region-wide localization for three
transcription factors (HNF-3b, HNF-4a and USF-1) and acetylated
histone H3 (H3ac). The heights of the peaks in the graphical display indicate
the ratio of enriched non-amplified DNA to input DNA. </P>
<P>
The raw data for this track is available at
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress">EBI ArrayExpress</A>, as experiment

2) Uppsala ChIP Butyrate <br>
ENCODE regions were investigated by ChIP-chip, analyzing both histone H3
acetylation (H3ac; H3 acetylated lysines 9 and14) and histone H4 acetylation
(H4ac; H4 acetylated lysined 5,8,12,16). This analysis was performed using
ChIP material obtained from cells that were either untreated or treated with
5mM Na-Butyrate for 12 hours. Na-Butyrate is a histone deacetylase inhibitor
(HDACi) that increases bulk levels of acetylated histones. Four tracks presented
in the genome browser represent the ChIP-chip signal obtained for either H3ac
or H4ac, using cells that were untreated or treated with butyrate: H3ac 0h,
H3ac 12h, H4ac 0h, H4ac 12h. Two additional tracks indicate those spots where
H3ac or H4ac levels are significantly changed by butyrate treatment.
