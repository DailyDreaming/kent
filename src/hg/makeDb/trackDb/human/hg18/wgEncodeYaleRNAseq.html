<H2> Description </H2>

<P>
This track shows enrichment of RNA sequence tags generated by high throughput 
sequencing (RNA-seq) and mapped to the human genome.  Double stranded cDNA 
was synthesized from fragmented PolyA RNA, and the PCR amplified adapter ligated 
cDNAs, 150-300 nt long, were sequenced using Illumina GA.
</p>
<P>This track shows <em>expression</em> data generated as confirmation
of the
<A HREF="hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeYaleChIPseq">Yale TFBS</A> tracks.

<!--
<P>This track shows probable binding sites of the specified transcription
factors (TFs) in the given cell types as determined by chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq).
Included for each cell type is the input signal, which represents the control
condition where no antibody targeting was performed.
For each experiment (cell type vs. antibody) this track shows
a graph of enrichment for TF binding (<I>Signal</I>), along with
sites that have the greatest evidence of transcription factor binding (<I>Peaks</I>).
<P>
The sequence reads, quality scores, and alignment coordinates from
these experiments are available for download.

<H2> Display Conventions and Configuration </H2>
<P>
This is a composite track that contains multiple data types
(<EM>views</EM>).  Instructions for configuring composite
tracks are <A HREF="../../goldenPath/help/multiView.html" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.
ENCODE tracks typically contain one or more of the following views:
<DL>
<DT><I>Signal</I></DT><DD>Density graph (wiggle) of signal enrichment based 
on processed data.</DD>
<DT><I>Alignments</I></DT><DD>Mappings of short reads to the genome.  These 
are only available as downloadable files.<DD>
</DL>

<H2> Methods </H2>
<P>
Cells were grown according to the approved
<A HREF="../../ENCODE/protocols/cell" TARGET=_BLANK>ENCODE cell culture protocols</A>.
Trizol Reagent (15596-018, Life Tech) was added to the cell pellet and total RNA 
was extracted using the protocol provided by the manufacturer. PolyA RNA was 
purified using MicroPoly(A) Purist kit (AM1919, Life Tech) and  was fragmented 
using RNA Fragmentation Reagent (AM8740, Life Tech). Illumina adapters were 
ligated to double stranded cDNA which were synthesized using reagents from Life Tech 
(11917-010). PCR amplified adapter ligated cDNA (150-300 bp) was sequenced 
using Illumina GA. Sequence reads of 27-33 nt long and with 0-2 mismatches 
were mapped to the genome. 
From the mapped tags, a signal map of ChIP DNA fragments was constructed where 
the signal height is the number of overlapping fragments at each nucleotide 
position in the genome.
