<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
This super track groups related tracks from UCDavis ChIP-chip experiments.
These tracks contain ChIP-chip data for transcription
factors in multiple cell lines. Data are displayed as signals and hits.

ChIP analysis was performed using antibodies to E2F1, c-Myc, TAFI and PolII
in HeLa, GM06990 and/or HelaS cells.
E2F1 and c-Myc protein are transcription factors related to growth.
E2F1 is important in controlling cell division, and c-Myc is associated
with cell proliferation and neoplastic disease.
TAFI is a general transcription factor that is a key part of the pre-initiation
complex found on the promoter. PolII is RNA polymerase II.

<P>
For E2F1 and c-Myc, three independently crosslinked preparations of HeLa cells
were used to provide three independent biological replicates.  ChIP
assays were performed (with minor modifications which can be provided
upon request) using the protocol found at
<A HREF="http://genomics.ucdavis.edu/farnham/" 
TARGET=_blank>The Farnham Laboratory</A>.  
Array hybridizations were performed using standard
<A HREF="http://www.nimblegen.com/" TARGET=_blank>NimbleGen Systems</A>
conditions.</P>
<P>
For TAFI and PolII, crosslinked cells were supplied officially by the ENCODE
Consortium (for reference, see
<A HREF="http://ccr.coriell.org/Sections/Collections/NIGMS/?SsId=8"
TARGET=_blank>The Human Genetic Cell Repository</A>). Hence, this data may be 
compared to other tracks using this exact
source of cells. (Note that this is different from the E2F1 and c-myc
subtracks - those Hela cells were grown in the Farnham lab.)</P>
<P>
ChIP-chip and amplification procedures are according to standard protocols
available in detail from the 
<A HREF="http://genomics.ucdavis.edu/farnham/" TARGET=_blank>Farnham Lab</A> 
website.
Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) was used for these samples.
Array processing was performed by
<A HREF="http://www.nimblegen.com/" TARGET=_blank>NimbleGen, Inc</A>.
The supplied array data is the result of three biological replicates in
each case.</P>
