<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
This super-track groups related tracks from the Genome Institute 
of Singapore.  These tracks show transcriptome and protein binding
sites as determined by paired-end ditag 
(PET) sequencing.

Experiments were performed in a variety of cell lines,
including MCF7 (breast adenocarcinoma), HCT116 (colon epithelial carcinoma),  
HeLa (cervical carcinoma),
hES3 (embryonic stem), and P493 (B cell), with various treatments, including
estrogen, 5-flourouracil, and gamma interferon.
Binding sites are displayed for multiple transcription factors and
histone modifications, including p53, STAT1, c-Myc,  
H3K4me3 and H3K27me3,
