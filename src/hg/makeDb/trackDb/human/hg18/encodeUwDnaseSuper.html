This track shows DNaseI sensitivity measured across ENCODE regions using
the Quantitative Chromatin Profiling (QCP) method (Dorschner <em>et al.</em>
(2004)). DNaseI has long been used to map general chromatin accessibility and
the DNaseI &quot;hyperaccessibility&quot; or &quot;hypersensitivity&quot;
that is a universal feature of active <em>cis</em>-regulatory sequences.
The use of this method has lead to the discovery of functional
regulatory elements that
include enhancers, insulators, promotors, locus control regions and novel
elements. DNaseI hypersensitivity signifies chromatin accessibility following
binding of trans-acting factors in place of a canonical nucleosome,
and is a universal feature of active cis-regulatory sequences in vivo.
<P>
QCP provides a quantitative high-throughout method for the
mapping DNaseI sensitivity as a continuous function of genome position. The
moving baseline of mean DNaseI sensitivity is computed using a
locally-weighted least squares (LOWESS)-based algorithm.</P>
<P>
DNase-array methodology was described in Sabo <em>et al.</em> (2006).
Peaks in DNaseI sensitivity signal measured using DNase/Array represent
DNaseI hypersensitive sites.
