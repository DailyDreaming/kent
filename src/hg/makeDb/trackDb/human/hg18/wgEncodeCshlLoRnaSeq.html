</DL>

<H2>Methods</H2>

Cells were grown according to the approved 
<A HREF="../../ENCODE/protocols/cell" TARGET=_BLANK>ENCODE cell culture protocols</A>.
<P>
Oligo-dT selected Poly-A+ RNA was ribominus treated according to the
manufacturers protocol (Invitrogen). The RNA was treated with Tobacco Alkaline
Pyrophosphatase to eliminate any 5&prime; cap structures and hydrolyzed to ~200
bases via alkaline hydrolysis.  The 3&prime; end was repaired using Calf
Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase and Poly-A Polymerase was used to catalyze the
addition C's to the 3&prime; end.   The 5&prime; end was phosphorylated using T4
PNK and a RNA linker was ligated onto the 5&prime; end.  Reverse transcription
was carried out using a poly-G oligo with a defined 5&prime; extension.  The
inserts were then amplified using oligo's targeting the 5&prime; linker and
poly-G extension.  This cloning protocol generates stranded reads that are read
from the 5&prime; ends of the inserts.  The library was sequenced on a Solexa
platform for a total of 36 cycles however the reads undergo post-processing
resulting in trimming of their 3&prime; ends. Consequently, the mapped read
lengths are variable. 
</P>

<H2>Analysis</H2>
<P>
The reads were mapped to hg18 using Timo Lassmann's program NexAlign as follows:

Only uniquely (one loci) exactly (no mis-matches) aligned reads are reported in
the processed files.

<OL>
<LI>Collect the read sequences from Illumina non-filtered output files.
</LI>
<LI>Filter out all reads that contain undefined nucleotides ('N')
</LI>
<LI>Perform iterative alignment/C-tail chopping algorithm (below). On each
alignment step below the reads are aligned to the genome with 100% identity. 
All reads that align to a single locus are withdrawn from the alignment pool and
only the reads that could not be aligned continue to the next step.
  <OL type="a">
  <LI>Align to hg18 genome using Nexalign 1.3.3 (&copy; Timo Lassmann) without
  chopping off any nucleotides
  </LI>
  <LI>Chop off any C-blocks (until the first non-C) at the end of the reads.
  </LI>
  <LI>Align to the genome -> remove and save those that align
  </LI>
  <LI>Chop of any non-Cs until the next C.
  </LI>
  <LI>Chop off C-block until the next non-C.
  </LI>
  <LI>Align to the genome -> remove and save those that align
  </LI>
  <LI>Repeat steps d,e,f until the reads align to the genome, or chopping 
  results in the reads' lengths reduce to below 16 (default), or there are 
  no non-Cs left.
  </LI>
