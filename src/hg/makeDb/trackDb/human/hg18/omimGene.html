<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=omim">
OMIM</A> Related Genes are a set of UCSC canonical genes that 
might be referenced by OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) database, 
based on the cross-reference info from RefSeq and UniProt.
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
First, compile a set of all UCSC genes having cross-reference to RefSeq genes 
that have non-empty OMIM IDs (according to the refLink table).
Then compile another set of UCSC genes that their corresponding UniProt proteins
have MIM external DB links (using the spXref2 table of the proteome database).
Put these two gene sets (each gene now has the associated OMIM ID in addition 
to UCSC Gene ID) together and remove duplicates.
<P>
Leverage the UCSC canonical gene set (represented by the knownIsoforms and 
knownCanonical tables) to replace each individual UCSC gene in the above gene 
set with its UCSC canonical gene, remove duplicates, sort and load the result 
into the omimGene table.
<P>
The genemap file downloaded from OMIM web site is loaded as the omimGeneMap 
table.  The title lines of this table are used in the OMIM Related Genes 
details page.
