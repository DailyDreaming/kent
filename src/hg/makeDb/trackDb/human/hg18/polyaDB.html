<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The PolyA_DB database is a set of $organism mRNA polyadenlyation sites based
on EST/cDNA evidence.  The track has 28,893 annotated poly(A) cleavage sites.  
This is a single base denoting the beginning of a poly(A) tail in a nascent
mRNA transcript and is typically 10-30 nucleotides downstream of a PAS 
(polyadenylation signal), the most common being AAUAAA (or AATAAA on the 
DNA).
