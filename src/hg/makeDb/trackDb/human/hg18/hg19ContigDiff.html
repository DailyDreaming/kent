<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track indicates differences in the human genome assembly from
this version, NCBI Build 36(hg18), to the next assembly GRCh37(hg19).
Contigs used in this assembly, NCBI Build 36(hg18), that were not
carried forward to GRCh37(hg19) are shown.
</P>
<P>
Differences can be attributed to:
<UL>
<LI>Contigs dropped from this assembly as the assembly was improved
<LI>Updated versions of the same contig were used to correct errors in the sequence
<LI>Different portions of the same contig used in this assembly compared to the next assembly
</UL>
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The contig coordinates were extracted from the AGP files for the assemblies.
Contigs that match the same name, same version, and the identical specific
portion of sequence from the contig are noted as identical in the two
assemblies.  Contigs not satisifying those identical characteristics are
included in this track.
