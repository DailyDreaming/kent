<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows transcription levels for several cell types as assayed by high throughput
sequencing of polyadenylated RNA (RNA-seq).
Additional views of this data set and additional documentation on the methods used
for this track are available at the
<A HREF=../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeCaltechRnaSeq>ENCODE Caltech RNA-seq</A> page.  The <i>Raw 
Signal</i> view derived from the paired 75-mer reads is shown here.

<H2>Display conventions</H2>
<p>By default this track uses a transparent overlay method of displaying data from a number of cell 
lines in the same vertical space.  The same colors are used for 
the same cell lines in this track, and in the histone mark tracks that are part of the
<A HREF=../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeReg>ENCODE Regulation</a> supertrack.
These colors are relatively light and saturated so as to work best with the transparent overlay.  
Unfortunately, outside of the ENCODE Regulation tracks older color conventions are used that are darker which  
don't work well with transparency.
