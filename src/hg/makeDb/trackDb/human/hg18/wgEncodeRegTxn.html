<h2>Description</h2>
This track shows transcription levels for several cell types as assayed by high throughput
sequencing of polyadenylated RNA (RNA-seq) by the Wold Lab at Cal Tech, part of the ENCODE 
consortium. Additional views of this data set and additional documentation on the methods used
for this track are available from the 
<A HREF=../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeCaltechRnaSeq>ENCODE Caltech RNA-seq</A> page.  The <i>Raw 
Signal</i> view derived from the paired 75-mer reads is shown here.
