<P>
This track displays the SNPs used in genotyping platforms.
<H2>Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0</H2>
The SNP Array 5.0 is a single microarray featuring all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the 
original two-chip Mapping 500K Array Set, as well as 420,000 additional non-polymorphic probes that can 
measure other genetic differences, such as copy number variation.
<H2>Affymetrix 500K (250K Nsp and 250K Sty)</H2>
This annotation displays the SNPs available for genotyping with the 
GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set from Affymetrix.  It is comprised of
two arrays: Nsp and Sty, which contain approximately 262,000 and 238,000 SNPs,
respectively.
<H2>Illumina 300K</H2>
This annotation displays the SNPs available for genotyping with Illumina's
HumanHap300 BeadChip.  The HumanHap300 contains over 317,000 tagSNP markers
derived from the International HapMap Project.

<H2>Methods</H2>
Position, strand, and polymorphism data were obtained from Affymetrix and 
supplemented with links to corresponding dbSNP rsIDs based on a positional
lookup into dbSNP build 126. In fewer than 2% of the cases, a dbSNP rsID was
not present in dbSNP build 126 at the Affymetrix array position. Reference
allele information was retrieved from the UCSC database based on Affymetrix
position and strand data.

Illumina data were supplied as rsIDs and was supplemented with position, strand,
and polymorphism data based on a name lookup into dbSNP build 126. Reference
allele information was retrieved from the UCSC database based on dbSNP position
and strand data.
