This track displays the SNPs used in genotyping platforms.
<H2>Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0</H2>

<H2>Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0</H2>
The SNP Array 5.0 is a single microarray featuring all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the 
original two-chip Mapping 500K Array Set, as well as 420,000 additional non-polymorphic probes that can 
measure other genetic differences, such as copy number variation.
<H2>Affymetrix 500K (250K Nsp and 250K Sty)</H2>
This annotation displays the SNPs available for genotyping with the 
GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set from Affymetrix.  It is comprised of
two arrays: Nsp and Sty, which contain approximately 262,000 and 238,000 SNPs,
respectively.

<H2>Illumina HumanHap650Y</H2>
This annotation displays the SNPs available for genotyping with Illumina's
HumanHap650Y Genotyping BeadChip.  The HumanHap650Y contains over 650,000 markers,
extending the HumanHap550 by adding 100,000 additional Yoruba-specific tag
SNPs.  On average, there is 1 SNP every 5.3kb, 6.2kb and 5.4kb across
the genome in the CEU, CHB+JPT and YRI populations, respectively.
The HumanHap650Y was derived from release 21 of the International HapMap Project.

<H2>Illumina HumanHap550</H2>
This annotation displays the SNPs available for genotyping with Illumina's
HumanHap550 Genotyping BeadChip.  The HumanHap550 contains over 550,000 markers,
the majority of which are tag SNPs 
derived from release 20 of the International HapMap Project.    In addition,
approximately 7800 non-synonymous SNPs, a higher density of tag SNPs in
the MHC region, over 150 mitochrondrial SNPs and over 4000
SNPs from regions with copy number polymorphism were included.   
In the CEU population, an r-squared threshold of 0.8 was used
for common SNPs in genes, within 10kb of genes or in evolutionarily
conserved regions.  For all other regions, an r-squared threshold of 0.7 was used.
On average, there is 1 SNP every 5.5kb, 6.5kb and 6.2kb across the genome in 
the CEU, CHB+JPT and YRI populations, respectively.

<H2>Illumina HumanHap300</H2>
This annotation displays the SNPs available for genotyping with Illumina's
HumanHap300 Genotyping BeadChip.  The HumanHap300 contains over 317,000 tagSNP markers
derived from Phase I of the International HapMap Project.    In addition,
approximately 7300 non-synonymous SNPs and a higher density of tag SNPs in
the MHC region were included.   On average, there is 1 SNP every 9 kb across
the genome and median spacing is 5kb.

<H2>Methods</H2>
Position, strand, and polymorphism data were obtained from Affymetrix and 
supplemented with links to corresponding dbSNP rsIDs based on a positional
lookup into dbSNP.   The Affy 6.0 Array is based on dbSNP build 127; the Affy 5.0 Array 
is based on dbSNP build 126. The Affy 500K Array is based on dbSNP build 125 
and was translated from hg17 by UCSC using rsId lookup.  
In fewer than 2% of the cases, a dbSNP rsID was
not present in dbSNP at the Affymetrix array position. 
Reference allele information was retrieved from the UCSC database based on dbSNP position
and strand data.

Illumina data were supplied as rsIDs, position, strand, and polymorphism data based on dbSNP build 126. 
Reference allele information was retrieved from the UCSC database based on dbSNP position
and strand data.   The Illumina arrays are comprised of probes for 4 of the possible single-base substitutions:
A/C, A/G, C/T and G/T.  A/T and C/G probes will be available in future arrays.
