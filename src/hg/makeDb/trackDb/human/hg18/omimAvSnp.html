<!--#insert file="../omimDescriptionText.html"-->

<P>
This track shows the 	
OMIM Allelic Variant SNPs 
in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(<A HREF="http://www.omim.org/"
TARGET=_blank>OMIM</A>) database.
</P>
 
<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>Genomic positions of OMIM Allelic Variant SNPs are marked by solid blocks, which appear
as tick marks when zoomed out.  
<P> The details page for each variant displays the amino acid replacement, dbSNP ID, 
and allelic variant description.
</P>

<P>On the main browser display, when <TT>Full</TT> display mode is chosen, the description 
of the OMIM entry is shown in the browser image.  In <TT>Pack</TT> mode, the description 
is shown when mousing over each entry.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
This track was constructed as follows: 
<UL>
<LI>The OMIM allelic variant data file, <TT>mimAV.txt</TT>, is obtained from OMIM and 
loaded into an MySQL table <TT>omimAv</TT>.
<LI>The genomic positions of indvidual allelic variant SNPs are obtained from the 
<TT>snp130</TT> table and compiled into a BED file and then loaded into the 
<TT>omimAvSnp</TT> table.  <B><FONT COLOR=RED>Note: The latest OMIM annotation contains many dbSNP snp132 (available only for hg19) entries, which are not availble in snp130; hence we srongly suggest and encourage users to use our hg19 OMIM Allelic Variant SNPs track instead of this hg18 one.</FONT>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
Thanks to OMIM and NCBI for the use of their data. This track was constructed by Fan Hsu,
Robert Kuhn, and Brooke Rhead of the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group.</P>
