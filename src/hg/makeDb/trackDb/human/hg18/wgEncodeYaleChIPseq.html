<H2> Description </H2>

<P>These tracks show probable binding sites of the specified transcription 
factors (TFs) in the given cell types as determined by chromatin 
immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq). 
The tracks are grouped by TF-targeted antibody and by cell type.  Included 
for each cell type is the input signal, which represents the control 
condition where no antibody targeting was performed.  Within a grouping 
there will be one or more of the following tracks:
<UL>
<LI><B><I>Raw Signal</I></B> of aligned read density
<LI><B><I>Signal</i></B> of replicate combined and input (control) subtracted 
  read density
<LI>Called <B><I>Peaks</I></B> which represent the sites with the greatest
evidence of TF binding obtained from these experiments.
</UL>
</P>

<H2> Methods </H2>
<P>
Cell preparations were similar to those previously published 
(Euskirchen <EM>et al.</EM>, 2007) with the exceptions that the cells 
were unstimulated and sodium orthovanadate was omitted from the buffers.
</P>

<H3> Extraction protocol </H3>
<p>All cells were grown either: (PolII and input control) at the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN )
in Joklik's modified MEM supplemented 5% Newborn Calf Serum to a density of 5 x10^5 cells/ml.; or (Stat1 and
input control) in Minimum Essential Medium modified for Suspension (SMEM, Invitrogen), supplemented with glutamine,
10% FBS, and antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin) at 37&deg;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, to a density of 5 x10^5 cells/ml and
then stimulated at these same growth conditions for 30 min with 5 ng/ml human recombinant
IFN-&gamma; (R&amp;D Systems #285-IF).
</p>
<p>
All cells were then were fixed with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Fixation was
terminated with 125 mM glycine, and cells were washed twice in cold 1x PBS, and then swelled on ice in
hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM
PMSF, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate and Roche complete protease inhibitors). Cell lysates were homogenized
with 30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer (Kontes, pestle B). Nuclear pellets were collected and lysed in
1x RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.5
mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors). Chromatin was sheared with a
Branson 250 Sonifier (output setting 2, 100% duty cycle, seven 30-second pulses) to an average of 700
bp as verified on a 1.5% agarose gel.
</p><p>Clarified lysates for ChIP samples were agitated overnight at 4&deg;C with antibody. Following this
incubation, Protein A agarose beads (Upstate-Millipore #16-156) were added and allowed to bind for 60
min at 4&deg;C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in 1x RIPA, once in 1x PBS, and then eluted in
1xTE/1%SDS.  Clarified lysates for input DNA samples were stored overnight at 4&deg;C in parallel with ChIP
experiments.
</p>
<p>
For ChIP and input samples, crosslinks were reversed overnight at 65&deg;C. ChIP DNA was purified
by incubation with RNase A for 1 h at 37C, with 200 ug/ml Proteinase K for 2 h at 45&deg;C, phenol:chloroform:isoamyl
alcohol extraction, and precipitation with 0.1 volumes of 3M sodium acetate, 2 volumes of 100% ethanol
and 1.5 ul of pellet paint (Novagen).
</p>
<p>
ChIP-DNA sequencing libraries were prepared according to Illumina's instructions accompanying
the DNA Sample Kit (Part# 0801-0303).
</p>

<h3>Scoring of ChIP-Seq Data</h3>
<p>Only sequence reads (length ~30 bps) that align uniquely (using Eland) with at most two mismatches
against the hg18 build of the human genome are used. From the mapped tags a signal map of ChIP DNA
fragments (average fragment length ~ 200 bps) is constructed where the signal height is the number of
overlapping fragments at each nucleotide position in the genome. For each 1Mb segment of each chromosome
a peak height threshold is determined by requiring a false discovery rate &lt;= 0.05 when comparing the
number of peaks above threshold as compared the number obtained from multiple simulations of a random
null background with the same number of mapped reads (also accounting for the fraction of mapable bases
for sequence tags in that 1Mb segment). The number of mapped tags in a putative binding region is compared
against the normalized (normalized by correlating tag counts in genomic 10 Kb windows) number of mapped
tags in the same region from an input DNA control. Using a binomial test only regions that have a
p-value &lt;= 0.05 are considered to be significantly enriched compared to the input DNA control.
