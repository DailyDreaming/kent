<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This super track groups related tracks from Yale ChIP-chip analysis, including
signals, p-values and site predictions for each factor, as well as Regulatory
Factor Binding Regions (RFBR) predictions.
</P>
<P>
1) Yale STAT1 pVal <br>
2) Yale STAT1 Sig <br>
3) Yale STAT1 Sites <br>
These track show probable sites of STAT1 binding and map of signal intensity
in HeLa cells
as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by
microarray analysis.
<P>
These data are available at NCBI GEO as
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE2714"
TARGET=_blank>GSE2714</A>, which also provides additional information about
the experimental protocols.</P>

<P>
4) Yale ChIP pVal <br>
5) Yale ChIP Sig <br>
6) Yale ChIP Sites <br>

These tracks shows the map of -log10(P-value), map of signal intensity
and probable sites for ChIP-chip using DNA from
immunoprecipitated chromatin from either human
<A HREF="http://www.atcc.org/common/catalog/numSearch/numResults.cfm?atccNum=CCL-2.2" TARGET=_blank>HelaS3</A> (cervix epithelial adenocarcinoma), <A HREF=

TARGET=_blank>GM06990</A>
(lymphoblastoid) or
<A HREF="http://www.atcc.org/common/catalog/numSearch/numResults.cfm?atccNum=CCL-243" TARGET=_blank>K562</A> (myeloid leukemia-derived) cells hybridized to
maskless photolithographic arrays. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation was carried out for each experiment using antibodies
against the following targets: BAF155, BAF170, INI1/BAF47, c-Fos, c-Jun,
TAF1/TAFII250, RNA polymerase II, histone H4 tetra-acetylated lysine
(H4Kac4), histone H3 tri-methylated lysine (H3K27me3), STAT1, nuclear factor
kappa B (NFKB) p65, SMARCA4/BRG1, SMARCA6 and NRSF. Additionally, HeLa S3 cells
immunoprecipitated with STAT1 were pre-treated with interferon-alpha and
HeLa S3 cells immunoprecipitated with NFKB antibody were pre-treated with
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).

7) Yale ChIP RFBR <br>
Regulatory Factor Binding Regions (RFBRs) were identified from ChIP-Chip
experimental data; they are non-randomly distributed in the ENCODE regions
with local enrichment and depletion. By mapping the full set of RFBRs onto the
human genome sequence, we identified 689 genomic subregions with RFBR
enrichment and 726 subregions with RFBR depletion (the RFBR clusters and
deserts, respectively) in the ENCODE regions.

<P>
This data was generated and analyzed by the labs of Michael
Snyder, Mark Gerstein and Sherman Weissman at Yale University. The PCR
Amplicon arrays were manufactured by Bing Ren's lab at UCSD.</P>

<P>
The RFBR data set was made available by the Transcriptional Regulation Group of the
ENCODE Project Consortium. The RFBR cluster and desert tracks were generated
by Zhengdong Zhang from Mark Gerstein's group at Yale University.
