<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
This super track groups related tracks of ChIP data generated by
the UT Austin (<A HREF="http://microarray.icmb.utexas.edu/"
TARGET=_blank>The Iyer Laboratory</A>).
</P>
<P>
Two technologies are presented in this super track: ChIP-chip and ChIP-STAGE.
ChIP-chip, also known as genome-wide location analysis, is a technique for
isolation and identification of DNA sequences bound by specific proteins in
cells. Insteading of detecting bound fragments by microarray, ChIP-STAGE uses
Sequence Tag Analysis of Genomic Enrichment, or STAGE, technology by cloning 
STAGE tags, sequenceing and mapping to the human genome.
</P>
<P>
These tracks contain ChIP data for several transcription
factors, including c-Myc, E2F4 and STAT1, in 2091 foreskin 
fibroblasts and HeLa cells. </P>
