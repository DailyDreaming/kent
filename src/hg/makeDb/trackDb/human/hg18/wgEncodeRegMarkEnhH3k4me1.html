<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
This track shows the levels of occupancy for the modified histone H3K4Me1 as determined by a 
ChIP-seq assay.  This histone mark is associated with enhancers and downstream of transcription 
starts.  Additional histone marks and other chromatin associated ChIP-seq data is available at 
the <A HREF=../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeBroadChipSeq>Broad Histone</A> page.  
</p>
<H2>Display conventions</H2>
<p>By default this track uses a transparent overlay method of displaying data from a number of cell 
lines in the same vertical space.  The same colors are used for 
the same cell lines in this track, and in other tracks that are part of the
<A HREF=../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeReg>ENCODE Regulation</a> supertrack.
These colors are relatively light and saturated so as to work best with the transparent overlay.  
Unfortunately outside the ENCODE Regulation older color conventions are used that are darker and so 
don't work as well with transparency.
