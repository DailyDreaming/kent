<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays conserved nonexonic elements that have been deposited
by mobile elements (repeats), a process termed "exaptation" (Gould 
<em>et al.</em>, 1982).
We identified these regions during a genome-wide survey (Lowe <em>et al.</em>, 
2007) and we believe that most of these regions act as distal transcriptional 
regulators for nearby genes.  A previous case study experimentally verified 
an exapted mobile element acting as a distal enhancer (Bejerano <em>et al.</em>
, 2006).

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
All regions were identified as having originated as mobile element insertions
by RepeatMasker (Smit <em>et al.</em>).  A subset of elements that have
clear repeat homology can be identified by very significant BLASTZ (Schwartz 
<em>et al.</em>, 2003)
alignments to consensus sequences in RepBase (Jurka <em>et al.</em>, 2000).
</P>

<P>
This dataset is from a genome-wide survey of mobile elements being exapted
as conserved nonexonic sequence; a full explanation of methods can
be found in Lowe <em>et al.</em>, 2007.
