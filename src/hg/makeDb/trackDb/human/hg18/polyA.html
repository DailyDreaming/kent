<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
There are two subtracks on the Poly(A) composite tracks.  One is the 
<B>PolyA_DB subtrack</B>, which are reported poly(A) sites.  The other 
is the <B>Poly(A) prediction subtrack</B>. 
</P> 
<P>
The PolyA_DB database is a set of $organism mRNA polyadenlyation sites based
on EST/cDNA evidence.  The track has 28,857 annotated poly(A) cleavage sites.  
This is a single base denoting the beginning of a poly(A) tail in a nascent
mRNA transcript and is typically 10-30 nucleotides downstream of a PAS 
(polyadenylation signal), the most common being AAUAAA (or AATAAA on the 
DNA).  The PolyA_DB web server is found at

The Poly(A) predictions are made using 1500 base DNA sequences centered at 
the end of each RefSeq gene.  The sequences are then inputted into the support 
vector machine described in <em>Cheng, et. al</em>.  The SVM scores each base
based on a model using 15 different cis elements.  High-scoring regions are 
highlighted with the highest-scoring base getting a thicker line.  The 
median length of these regions is 48 bases.
