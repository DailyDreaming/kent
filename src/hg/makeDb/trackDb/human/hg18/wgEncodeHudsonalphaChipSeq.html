<a name="Description"></a><h2> Description </h2>
<p>These tracks display binding sites of the specified transcription factors
in the given cell types as identified by ChIP-Seq (see Johnson DS,
<em>et al.</em>, 2007 and Fields S, 2007).  The ChIP-Seq method
uses formaldehyde to cross-link DNA associated proteins to genomic DNA within
living cells. The cross-linked cells are lysed and sonicated, releasing small
soluble chromatin fragments. The chromatin fragments bound by specific or
general transcription factors are immunoprecipitated by using an antibody
directed against a specific transcription factor of interest. After reversing
the chemical cross-links, the recovered DNA fragments are ligated to specific
double-stranded DNA adapters, size-selected (~225 bp) and sequenced. Short
reads of 25-35 bp are mapped to the human reference genome, generating peaks
or enriched regions of high read density relative to a total input chromatin
control reads.
</p>
<h2>Track Conventions</h2>
<p>
The tracks are grouped by transcription factor targeted antibody and by cell
type. Included for each cell type is a control signal, which represents the
control condition where no antibody targeting was performed. Within a grouping
there will be one or more of the following:
<ul>
<li>Raw Signal: a continuous signal which indicates density of aligned reads. The short reads (25 bp) 
produced by the sequencer are extended to the size-selected length (225 bp), and the read density is computed
by the UCSC bedItemOverlapCount utility.
</li>
<li>Called Peaks which represent the sites with the greatest evidence of
transcription factor binding</li>
</ul>

<a name="Methods"></a><h2> Methods </h2>
<p>Cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibody according to the
protocol posted <a href="http://myers.hudsonalpha.org/content/protocols.html"

Biological replicates from each cell line were tested.
</p>
<p>Libraries were generated from DNA fragments recovered from immunoprecipitation
and total input chromatin according to the protocol posted
<a href="http://myers.hudsonalpha.org/content/protocols.html"
TARGET=_blank title="http://myers.hudsonalpha.org/content/protocols.html"
rel="nofollow">here</a>.  Libraries were sequenced with an Illumina Genome
Analyzer (GA1) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
</p>

<p>Sequence data produced by the Illumina data pipeline software were quality
filtered and then mapped to hg18 using its integrated Eland software; only the
first 25 bp of reads were used for alignment; up to two mismatches were
tolerated; multiply mapped reads were discarded. To identify likely binding
sites, Peak Calling was applied on the aligned sequence data sets using
quantitative enrichment of sequence tags
(<a href="http://mendel.stanford.edu/sidowlab/downloads/quest" TARGET=_blank
title="http://mendel.stanford.edu/sidowlab/downloads/quest">QuEST</a>). (See
Valouev A, <em>et al.</em>, 2008.)
QuEST is based on the kernel density estimation approach, which uses ChIP-Seq
data to determine positions where protein complexes contact DNA. QuEST uses
data in the form of genome coordinates ('tags') obtained from mapping several
million sequencing reads to a reference genome. Tags from forward and reverse
reads cluster on opposite sides of the transcription factor binding site. QuEST
first constructs two separate profiles, one for forward and one for reverse
tags. QuEST identifies candidates for combined density profile (CDP) peaks as
positions in the reference genome corresponding to local maxima of the CDP with
sufficient enrichment compared to the control data.
</p>

<h2> Validation</h2>
<p>Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays can be used to
validate the transcription factor binding sites found using ChIP-Seq. Regions
of enriched read density reported by QuEST are reported as a single genomic
coordinate (peak) for each enriched region. These peaks are ranked according
to the ChIP-Seq enrichment ratio and qPCR assays are used to validate the set
of overlapping peaks between replicates for each cell line. qPCR primer pairs
were designed to interrogate the list of ordered peaks in common between
replicates. Amplicons were 60-100 bp in length and were completely contained
within 250 bp of either side of the peak coordinate. For each primer pair, qPCR
assays were performed on biological replicate ChIP samples on both cell lines
and total input chromatin DNA was recovered. Enrichment was calculated as a ratio of
amount of target DNA over the average of a pair of negative control primers.
An assay was considered positive when it had a two-fold or greater enrichment of
the average qPCR replicates (see Valouev A, <em>et al.</em>, 2008).
