<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
This track shows the levels of occupancy for the modified histone H3K4Me3 as determined by a 
ChIP-seq assay.  This histone mark is associated with promoters that are active or poised to be
activated.  Additional histone marks and other chromatin associated ChIP-seq data is available at 
the <A HREF=../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeBroadChipSeq>Broad Histone</A> page.  
</p>
<H2>Display conventions</H2>
<p>By default this track uses a transparent overlay method of displaying data from a number of cell 
lines in the same vertical space.  Each of the cell lines in this track is associated with a particular
color, and these cell line colors are consistent across all tracks that
are part of the <A HREF=../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeReg>ENCODE Regulation</a> supertrack.
These colors are relatively light and saturated so as to work best with the transparent overlay.  
Unfortunately, outside the ENCODE Regulation tracks, older cell line
color conventions are used that don't match the cell line colors used in
the ENCODE Regulation tracks. The older colors were not used in the
ENCODE Regulation tracks because they were too dark for the transparent
overlay.
