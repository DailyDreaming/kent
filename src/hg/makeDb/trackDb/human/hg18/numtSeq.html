<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
<b>NumtS</b> (NumtS mitochondrial sequences) are genomic sequences showing
significant similarity with mitochondrial genome. The most credited
hypothesis concerning their generation suggests that in presence of
mutagenic agents or under stress conditions fragments of mtDNA escape
from mitochondria, reach the nucleus and insert into chromosomes
during break repair, although NumtS can derive from duplication of
genomic fragments. NumtS may be cause of contamination during human
mtDNA sequencing and hence frequent false low heteroplasmic evidences
have been reported.



<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
These tracks show the High Score Pairs (HSPs) obtained by aligning the
mitochondrial reference genome (NC_012920) with the hg18 release of the
human genome. Four different tracks were produced:
<ol>
<li><b>"NumtS"</b> track:
<p>
The "NumtS" track shows the mapping of the HSPs aforementioned on the
nuclear genome. The shading of the items reflects the similarity
returned by BlastN, and the direction of the arrows is concordant with
the strand of the alignment.
<p>
For every item, a link pointing to
the mitochondrial mapping is provided, thus allowing a fast cross
among the NumtS genomic contexts.
</li>

<li><b>"NumtS assembled"</b> track:
<p>
The "NumtS assembled" track shows items obtained by assembling HSPs
fulfilling the following conditions:
 <ul type="disc">  
 <li> the orientation of their alignments must be concordant.
 <li> the distance between them must be less than 2 kb, on the
mitochondrial genome as well as on the nuclear genome.
  </ul>
<p>
 Exceptions for the second condition arise when a long repetitive
element is present between two HSPs.
<p>
 Every item has an external link providing additional information
[work in progress].

<li><b>"NumtS on mitochondrion"</b> track:
<p>
The "NumtS on mitochondrion" track shows the mapping of the HSPs on
the mitochondrial genome. The shading of the items reflects the
similarity returned by BlastN, and the direction of the arrows is
concordant with the strand of the alignment.


<li><b>"NumtS on mitochondrion with chromosome placement"</b> track:
The "NumtS on mitochondrion with chromosome placement" shows the
mapping of the HSPs on the mitochondrial genome, but the items are
coloured according to the colours assigned to each human chromosome on the UCSC genome browser. No shading is here provided.

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
NumtS predicted in silico were validated by carrying out PCR amplification and sequencing on blood-extracted DNA of a healthy individual of European origin. PCR amplification was successful for 155 NumtS and provided amplicons of the expected length. All PCR fragments were sequenced on both strands.

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
These data were provided by Domenico Simone and Marcella Attimonelli at Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology "Ernesto Quagliariello" (University of Bari, Italy). Primer designing was carried out by Francesco Calabrese and Giuseppe Mineccia. Validation was carried out by Martin Lang, Domenico Simone and Giuseppe Gasparre.
