<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Target protein STAT1 (Santa Cruz SC-345) was purified by chromatin immunoprecipitation from HeLaS3 (cervix epithelial adenocarcinoma) cells. The series is comprised of three biological replicates, done using ChIP-Sequencing on a Solexa machine. DNA fragments are selected for sizes in the ranged 100-300 bps and then 27nts tags are then sequenced from the ends of these fragments.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The sequenced tags are mapped onto the hg18 build of the human genome using Eland and only tags that map uniquely with at most two mismatches are included. 6,540,633 tags were mapped uniquely to the genome from the combined data from the three biological replicates.
</P><P>
82,440 STAT1 binding sites were determined using a peak threshold of 7 overlapping mapped fragments which corresponds to an expected false discovery rate of less than 0.1 % as estimated by computer simulation.
