<H2>Description</H2>

<P>This track shows DNaseI sensitivity measured genome-wide using the 
Digital DNaseI methodology (see below), and DNaseI hypersensitive sites.  
DNaseI has long been used to map general chromatin accessibility and 
DNaseI hypersensitivity is a universal feature of active 
<EM>cis</EM>-regulatory sequences. The use of this method has led 
to the discovery of functional regulatory elements that include enhancers, 
insulators, promotors, locus control regions and novel elements.</P>

<P>DNaseI-treated chromatin samples from the following cell types were studied:

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>DNaseI sensitivity is shown as the absolute density of <EM>in vivo</EM> 
cleavage sites across the genome mapped using the Digital DNasI methodology 
(see below).  Data have been normalized to 25 million reads per cell type.  
DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs) at False Discovery Rate (FDR) 0.5% are shown 
within each density track as colored red subregions.</P>
 
<P>The subtracks within this composite annotation track correspond to data from 
different cell types and tissues.  The graphical configuration options are 
shown at the top of the track description page, followed by a list of subtracks. To 
display only selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to 
hide. For more information about the graphical configuration options, click

<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>Digital DNaseI was performed by performing DNaseI digestion of intact 
nuclei, isolating DNaseI 'double-hit' fragments as described in 
Sabo <EM>et al.</EM> (2006), and direct sequencing of fragment 
ends (which correspond to <EM>in vivo</EM> DNaseI cleavage sites) 
using the Solexa platform (27 bp reads).  Uniquely mapping high-quality reads 
were mapped to the genome.  DNaseI sensitivity is directly reflected in 
raw tag density, which is shown in the track as density of tags 
mapping within a 150 bp sliding window (at a 20 bp step across the genome).  
DNaseI hypersensitive zones were identified using the HotSpot algorithm 
described in Sabo <EM>et al.</EM> (2004).  0.5% false discovery 
rate thresholds (FDR 0.005) were computed for each cell type by 
applying the HotSpot algorithm to an equivalent number of random 
uniquely mapping 27mers.  DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs) 
were identified as signal peaks within FDR 0.5% hypersensitive 
zones using a peak-finding algorithm.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>

<P>Data were verified by sequencing biological replicates displaying 
correlation coefficient >0.9.  Results are extensively validated by 
conventional DNaseI hypersensitivity assays using end-labeling/Southern 
blotting method. </P>

<H2>Credits</H2>

<P>These data were generated by the UW ENCODE group. </P>
