<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
These tracks display the level of sequence uniqueness of the reference hg18
genome.  They were generated using different window sizes and high signal
will be found in areas where the sequence is unique.

<H2> Display Conventions and Configuration </H2>
<P>
This track is a multi-view composite track that contains multiple data types
(<EM>views</EM>).  For each view, there are multiple subtracks that
display individually on the browser.  Instructions for configuring multi-view
tracks are <A HREF="../../goldenPath/help/multiView.html" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.
ENCODE tracks typically contain one or more of the following views:
<DL>
<DT><I>Peaks</I></DT><DD> Regions of signal enrichment based on processed data
(usually normalized data from pooled replicates). ENCODE Peaks tables contain
fields for statistical significance, including FDR
(<A HREF="../../goldenPath/help/qValue.html" TARGET=_BLANK>qValue</A>).</DD>
<DT><I>Signal</I></DT><DD>Density graph (wiggle) of signal enrichment based on
processed data.</DD>
<DT><I>Raw Signal</I></DT><DD>Density graph (wiggle) of signal from raw data
(single replicates, no control). For high-throughput sequencing data, this
reflects the aligned read density.</DD>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The <em>Broad alignability</em> track displays whether a region is made up of
mostly unique or mostly non-unique sequence. To generate the track, every
36-mer in the genome was marker as "unique" if the most similar 36-mer
elsewhere  in the genome have at most 2 mismatches, and as "non-unique"
otherwise. Position X in the alignable track is marked by 1 if >50% of the
bases in [X-200,X+200] are "unique" and by 0 otherwise. Every point in the
alignable track has a corresponding position in  each of the ChIP signal
tracks.

<P>
The <em>Duke uniqueness</em> tracks display how unique is each sequence on the
positive strand starting at a particular base and of a particular length.
Thus, the 20bp track reflects the uniqueness of all 20 base sequences with
the score being assigned to the first base of the sequence. Scores are
normalized to between 0 and 1 with 1 representing a completely unique
sequence and 0 representing the sequence occurs >4 times in the genome
(excluding chrN_random and alternative haplotypes).  A score of 0.5
indicates the sequence occurs exactly twice, likewise 0.33 for three times
and 0.25 for four times.
