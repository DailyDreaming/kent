<H2>Description</H2>
<p>These tracks contain information relevant to the regulation of transcription from the 
<A HREF=/ENCODE/>ENCODE project</A>. The <i>Transcription</i> subtrack shows transcription 
levels assayed by sequencing of polyadenylated RNA from a variety of cell types.  The <i>Enhancer
H3K4Me1</i> and <i>Promoter H3K4Me3</i> tracks show where the modification of histone proteins
is suggestive of enhancer and promoter activity respectively. These histone modifications, 
particularly H3K4Me1 are quite broad.  The actual enhancers are typically just a small portion
of the area marked by H3K4Me1. The <i>DNAse clusters</i> shows regions where the chromatin is
hypersensitive to cutting by the DNAse enzyme, which has been assayed in a large number of cell 
types. Regulatory regions in general tend to be DNAse sensitive, and promoters particularly so.
The <i>Txn Factor ChIP</i> shows regions where transcription factors, proteins responsible for 
modulating gene transcription, bind as assayed by chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies 
specific to the transcription factor followed by sequencing of the precipitated DNA.

These tracks complement each other, and together can shed much light on regulatory DNA. The histone
marks are informative at a high level, but have a resolution of just 200 bases or so, and do not
give you much in the way of functional detail.  The DNAse hypersensitive assay is higher resolution
at the base level, and as a single assay can be done on a large number of cell types. But at the functional level DNAse hypersensitivity tells you little beyond that the region is very likely to be 
regulatory in nature.  The transcription factor ChIP assay is high resolution at the DNA level, 
and often due to the very specific nature of the transcription factors, is informative functionally
in detail.  However since each transcription factor must be assayed separately, the information is
only available for a limited number of transcription factors on a limited number of cell lines. The
fact that all of these assays are relatively independent of each other gives increased confidence
when multiple tracks are suggesting a regulatory function for a region.
