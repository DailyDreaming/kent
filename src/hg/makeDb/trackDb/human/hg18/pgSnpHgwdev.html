<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays variant base calls from personal genomes that have been made
publicly available.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The alleles in the the details page are what is found on the plus strand.  
The nucleotide bases shown in the browser adjusts to the requested view, 
complementing and or reversing the nucleotides as needed.  
</P>
<P>
The frequency shown by box color, mouse overs, and on 
the details page is the read frequency of the alleles.

Aakrosh Ratan in the <A HREF="http://www.bx.psu.edu/miller_lab/"
TARGET=_BLANK>Miller Lab</A> at Pennsylvania State University (PSU)
mapped the sequence reads to the reference genome and called 
single-base variants using

[some ABI, some Illumina@Sanger?]  Don't have 1000 Genomes' blessing to 
release these publicly before dbSNP 130.

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
Variants shown in this track were determined by Applied Biosystems,
the 1000 Genomes Project and PSU.  
Thanks to Belinda Giardine at PSU for collecting the data and
loading them into the UCSC database.
