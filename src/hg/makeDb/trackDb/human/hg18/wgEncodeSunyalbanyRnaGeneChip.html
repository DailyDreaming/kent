<H2>Description</H2>

<P>This track shows expression of 
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=ripTgtProtein">
target RNA binding proteins (RBPs)</A>
as measured by RNA Immunoprecipitation and Affymetrix Exon Arrays 
(RIP-chip) using different
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=ripAntibody">
RIP antibodies</A>
in multiple 
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=cellType">cell lines</A>.
The <i>RBP Assoc RNA</i> view shows the genomic location of the transcripts 
associated with the array probes.  Data for this track was produced as part of the
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/ENCODE/index.html">
Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project</A>,
</P>

<P>In eukaryotic organisms gene regulatory networks require an additional 
level of coordination that links transcriptional and post-transcriptional 
processes. Messenger RNAs have traditionally been viewed as passive 
molecules in the pathway from transcription to translation. However, 
it is now clear that RNA-binding proteins play a major role in 
regulating multiple mRNAs in order to facilitate gene expression patterns. 
These tracks show the associated mRNAs that co-precipitated with the 
targeted RNA-binding proteins using RIP-Chip (Ribonomic) profiling
(Tenenbaum <EM>et al.</EM> 2002; Baroni <EM>et al.</EM> 2008; Penalva 
<EM>et al.</EM> 2004).

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>This track is a multi-view composite track. For each view there
are multiple subtracks that display individually in the browser.
The subtracks within this track correspond to different antibodies/target
proteins tested in different cell lines.
This track is initially released with a single view:
</P>
<DL>
<DT><i>RBP Assoc RNA</i>
<DD>The RBP Assoc RNA view shows the genomic extent of transcripts 
associated with 
the Affymetrix Exon Array probes, shaded according to score.
</DL>
Instructions for configuring multi-view
tracks are

<H2>Methods</H2>
RBP-mRNA complexes were purified from cells grown according to ENCODE 
<A HREF="../../ENCODE/protocols/cell">culture protocols </A> and the associated 
messages were identified using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays. For more 
information on this method, RNA-Binding protein Immunoprecipitation-Microarray 
(Chip) profiling or RIP-Chip, see Tenenbaum et al. 2002, Baroni et al. 2008, 
and Penalva et al. 2004.
