identifies distant-acting transcriptional enhancers in the human genome by coupling the identification of evolutionary conserved noncoding sequences with a moderate throughput mouse transgenesis enhancer assay.

The "Experimental Dataset" of conserved noncoding human sequences have been tested for enhancer activity in transgenic mice.
As of October 2006, approximately 300 elements can be found in this portion of the database and this number is expected to grow steadily. These sequences are based on build hg17, May 2004, UCSC.<br>
<br>
Elements which tested positive are given the score 900 and appear black.<br>
Elements which tested negative are given the score 100 and appear light grey.<br>
<br>
Non-coding elements identified as conserved in human, mouse, and rat are lifted
with primers and the PCR fragment cloned into a reporter vector which has a 
minimal promoter fused to LacZ.  This is then injected into a fertilized mouse egg
and the 11.5 day embryo is assayed for activity with lacZ stain.  Whole-embryo
in-situ pictures are available.<br>
<br>
Users should keep in mind that the assay captures only a single embryonic timepoint. A negative result reported in our experimental dataset does not necessarily imply that this conserved element is not a transcriptional enhancer, since it might be active at earlier or later timepoints in development.<br>
<br>
To be defined as a POSITIVE enhancer, an element has to show reproducible expression in the same structure in at least three independent transgenic embryos. Elements for which at least five transgenic embryos have been obtained, but no reproducible expression in any structure is observed in at least three different embryos are defined as NEGATIVE.
