<H2>Description</H2>
This track shows the locations of $organism contigs on the physical map. 
The underlying data is derived from the NCBI <em>seq_contig.md</em> file 
that accompanies this assembly. All contigs in this track are oriented to the 
&quot;+&quot; strand.

<H2>Method</H2>
For $organism genome reference sequences dated April 2003 and later,
the individual chromosome sequencing centers are responsible
for preparing the assembly of their chromosomes in 
<A HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/datorg.html">AGP</A> format. The
files provided by these centers are checked and validated at NCBI, and
form the basis for the <em>seq_contig.md</em> file that defines the physical map 
contigs.  All the NT contigs in this file are oriented to the &quot;+&quot; 
strand; therefore, this track does not show the orientation of contigs in the 
final assembly.
