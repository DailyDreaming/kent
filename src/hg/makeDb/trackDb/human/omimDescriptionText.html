<P>OMIM is a compendium of human genes and genetic phenotypes. The full-text,
referenced overviews in OMIM contain information on all known Mendelian
disorders and over 12,000 genes. OMIM is authored and edited at the
McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine, under the direction of Dr. Ada Hamosh.  This database
was initiated in the early 1960s by Dr. Victor A. McKusick as a catalog
of Mendelian traits and disorders, entitled Mendelian Inheritance
in Man (MIM).
