<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The experimental strategy adopted to map this profile involved 
isolation of replication products from HeLa cells synchronized 
at the G1-S boundary by thymidine-aphidicolin double block. Cells 
released from the block were labeled with BrdU at every two-hour 
interval of the 10 hours of S-phase and DNA was isolated from them. 
The heavy-light (H/L) DNA representing the pool of DNA replicated 
during each two-hour labeling period was separated from the unlabeled 
DNA by double cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. The 
purified H/L DNA was then hybridized to a high-density 
genome-tiling Affymetrix array comprised of all unique probes within 
the ENCODE regions.</P>
<P>
The time of replication of 50% (TR<SUB>50</SUB>) of each microarray probe was
calculated by accumulating the sum over the five time points and
linearly interpolating the time when 50% was reached.  Each probe
was also classed as temporally specific or non-specific based on
whether or not at least 50% of the accumulated signal appeared in a single
time point.</P>
<P>
The TR<SUB>50</SUB> data for the temporally specific probes were then smoothed
within a 95 kb window using lowess smoothing.  This smoothing was done
for three replicates (two biological and one technical) and for the
average of the three replicates.  Local minima were identified on the
smoothed TR<SUB>50</SUB> profiles to locate possible origins of replication.
The predictions were taken from the average of the replicates and then
given a width of 200 bp for display in the browser.  The confidence
intervals were identified as consensus sites among the three replicates
with endpoints taken on the outlying replicates for each consensus site.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
The replication experiments were completed for two biological sets and
a technical replicate in the HeLa adherent cell line.</P>

<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
ENCODE region-wide mapping of replication origins was performed by the bubble trapping method from HeLa (cervix carcinoma) cells.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The circular bubble DNA component of replication intermediates was enriched by agarose trapping and cloned to form a library. DNA from the library was labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix ENCODE tiling arrays, which have 25-mer probes tiled every 22 bp on average in the non-repetitive ENCODE regions. As experimental control, genomic DNA was hybridized to arrays independently.

Replication origins were identified by estimating the significance of the enrichment of the bubble-trapped DNA (treatment) signal over genomic DNA (control) signal in a sliding window of 10000 bp. An estimate of significance in the window was calculated by computing the p-value using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test over all three biological replicates and control signal estimates in that window. The origins (Ori-bubble) hence represented in the UCSC browser track are the genomic regions that showed signal enrichment pValue <= 0.001.

<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
ENCODE region-wide mapping of replication origins was performed.  Origin-centered nascent-strands were purified from HeLa (cervix carcinoma) and GM06990 (lymphoblastoid) cell lines and hybridized to Affymetrix ENCODE arrays.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Cells in their exponential stage of growth were labeled in culture with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 30 mins and DNA isolated. Nascent strands of 0.5-2.5kb representing the replication origins were purified by sucrose gradient followed by immunoprecipitation with BrdU antibody. The purified nascent strands were amplified and hybridized to Affymetrix ENCODE tiling arrays, which have 25-mer probes tiled every 22 bp on average in the non-repetitive ENCODE regions. As experimental control, genomic DNA was hybridized to arrays independently.

Replication origins were identified by estimating the significance of the enrichment of nascent strands DNA (treatment) signal over genomic DNA (control) signal in a sliding window of 1000bp. An estimate of significance in the window was calculated by computing the p-value using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test over all three biological replicates and control signal estimates in that window. The origins (Ori-NS) represented in the UCSC browser track are the genomic regions that showed signal enrichment pValue <= 0.001.
