<H3>Heavy-Light DNA Method (H-L DNA)</H3>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The experimental strategy adopted to map this profile involved 
isolation of replication products from HeLa cells synchronized 
at the G1-S boundary by thymidine-aphidicolin double block. Cells 
released from the block were labeled with BrdU at every two-hour 
interval of the 10 hours of S-phase and DNA was isolated from them. 
The heavy-light (H/L) DNA representing the pool of DNA replicated 
during each two-hour labeling period was separated from the unlabeled 
DNA by double cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. The 
purified H/L DNA was then hybridized to a high-density 
genome-tiling Affymetrix array comprised of all unique probes within 
the ENCODE regions.</P>
<P>
The time of replication of 50% (TR<SUB>50</SUB>) of each microarray probe was
calculated by accumulating the sum over the five time points and
linearly interpolating the time when 50% was reached.  Each probe
was also classed as temporally specific or non-specific based on
whether or not at least 50% of the accumulated signal appeared in a single
time point.</P>
<P>
The TR<SUB>50</SUB> data for the temporally specific probes were then smoothed
within a 95 kb window using lowess smoothing.  This smoothing was done
for three replicates (two biological and one technical) and for the
average of the three replicates.  Local minima were identified on the
smoothed TR<SUB>50</SUB> profiles to locate possible origins of replication.
The predictions were taken from the average of the replicates and then
given a width of 200 bp for display in the browser.  The confidence
intervals were identified as consensus sites among the three replicates
with endpoints taken on the outlying replicates for each consensus site.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
The replication experiments were completed for two biological sets and
a technical replicate in the HeLa adherent cell line.</P>

<H3>Bubble Trapping Method (Ori-Bubble)</H3>
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
ENCODE region-wide mapping of replication origins in HeLa (cervix carcinoma) 
cells was performed by the bubble trapping method. 

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The bubble trapping method works on the principle that circular plasmids can be
trapped in gelling agarose followed by the application of electrical current
for an prolonged period of time (see Mesner <em>et al</em>. 2006 for more 
details). Entrapment occurs by an apparent physical linkage of the circular 
DNA with the agarose matrix. The circular bubble component of the DNA 
replication intermediates was therefore enriched by agarose trapping. After 
recovery from the agarose gel, a library of the entrapped DNA was formed by DNA cloning. Subsequently, DNA from the library was labeled and hybridized to 
Affymetrix ENCODE tiling arrays, which have 25-mer probes tiled every 22 bp 
on average in the non-repetitive ENCODE regions. As an experimental control, 
genomic DNA was hybridized to arrays independently.

Replication origins were identified by estimating the significance of the 
enrichment of the bubble-trapped DNA (treatment) signal over genomic DNA 
(control) signal in a sliding window of 10,000 bp. An estimate of significance 
in the window was calculated by computing the p-value using the Wilcoxon 
Rank Sum test over all three biological replicates and the control signal 
estimates in that window. The origins (Ori-Bubble) hence represented in the 
UCSC browser track are the genomic regions that showed a signal enrichment 
pValue <= 0.001.

<H3>Nascent Strand Method (Ori-NS)</H3>
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
ENCODE region-wide mapping of replication origins was performed.  
Origin-centered nascent-strands purified from HeLa (cervix carcinoma) and 
GM06990 (lymphoblastoid) cell lines were hybridized to Affymetrix 
ENCODE arrays.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Cells in their exponential stage of growth were labeled, in culture, with 
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 30 mins. DNA was then isolated from the cells. 
Nascent strands of 0.5-2.5kb synthesized with incorporation of BrdU, 
representing the replication origins, were purified using a sucrose 
gradient followed by immunoprecipitation with BrdU antibody (Giacca 
<em>et al</em>., 1997). The purified nascent strands were amplified and 
then hybridized to Affymetrix ENCODE tiling arrays, which have 25-mer 
probes tiled every 22 bp on average in the non-repetitive ENCODE regions. As 
an experimental control, genomic DNA was hybridized to arrays independently.

Replication origins were identified by estimating the significance of the 
enrichment of nascent strands DNA (treatment) signal over genomic DNA 
(control) signal in a sliding window of 1000bp. An estimate of significance in 
the window was calculated by computing the p-value using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum 
test over all three biological replicates and control signal estimates in 
that window. The origins (Ori-NS) represented in the UCSC browser track are 
the genomic regions that showed a signal enrichment pValue <= 0.001.
