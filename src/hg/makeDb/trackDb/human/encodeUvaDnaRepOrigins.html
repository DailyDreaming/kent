<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The tracks in this annotation correspond to replication origin
predictions and confidence intervals for DNA synthesis.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The experimental strategy adopted to map this profile involved 
isolation of replication products from HeLa cells synchronized 
at the G1-S boundary by thymidine-aphidicolin double block and 
released from the block followed by BrdU labeling at every 
two-hour interval of the 10 hours of the S-phase. The heavy-light 
DNA representing the pool of DNA replicated during each two-hour 
labeling period was purified by double cesium chloride density 
gradient centrifugation and hybridized to a high-density 
genome-tiling Affymetrix array comprised of all unique probes 
within the ENCODE regions. 

The time of replication of 50% (TR50) of each microarray probe was
calculated by accumulating the sum over the 5 time points and
linearly interpolating the time when 50% was reached.  Each probe
was also classed as temporally specific or non-specific based on
whether at least 50% of the accumulated signal appeared in a single
time point or not.

The TR50 data for the temporally specific probes was then smoothed
within a 95KB window using lowess smoothing.  This smoothing was done
for three replicates (two biological and one technical) and for the
average of the three replicates.  Local minima were identified on the
smoothed TR50 profiles to identify possible origins of replication.
The predictions were take from the average of the replicates and then
given a width of 200bp for display in the browser.  The confidence
intervals were identified as concensus sites among the three replicates
with endpoints taken on the outlying replicates for each concensus site.

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
The replication experiments were completed for two biological sets and
a technical replicate in the HeLa adherent cell line.

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
Data generation and analysis for this track were performed by the
DNA replication group in the Dutta Lab at the University of 
Virginia: Neerja Karnani, Christopher Taylor, Hakkyun Kim,
Louis Lim, Ankit Malhotra, Gabe Robins and Anindya Dutta. 

Neerja Karnani and Christopher Taylor prepared the data for 
presentation in the UCSC Genome Browser.
