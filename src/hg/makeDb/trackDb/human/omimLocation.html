<!--#insert file="omimDescriptionText.html"-->

<P>
This track shows the cytogenetic locations of all enries
in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(<A HREF="http://www.omim.org/"
TARGET=_blank>OMIM</A>) database.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>Cytogenetic locations of OMIM entries are displayed as solid
blocks.  The entries are colored according to the OMIM phenotype class of associated disorders:

<UL>
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#AAC4AA">Lighter Green</FONT></B> for Class 1 OMIM records
-  the disorder is placed on the map based on its association with
a gene, but the underlying defect is not known.
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#669666">Light Green</FONT></B> for Class 2 OMIM records
- the disorder has been placed on the map by linkage; no mutation has
been found.
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#005000">Dark Green</FONT></B> for Class 3 OMIM records
- the molecular basis for the disorder is known; a mutation has been
found in the gene.
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#69329B">Purple</FONT></B> for Class 4 OMIM records
- a contiguous gene deletion or duplication syndrome, multiple genes
are deleted or duplicated causing the phenotype.
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#BEBEBE">Light Gray</FONT></B> for Others
- no associated OMIM phenotype class info available.
</UL>
<P> Gene symbol and disease information, when available, are displayed on the details page for an
item.
</P>

<P>On the main browser display, the description of the OMIM entry are shown when Full display mode
is chosen.  In Pack mode, the entry description is shown when mousing over each entry.
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
This track was constructed as follows: 
<UL>
<LI>The OMIM <TT>genemap</TT> data file was downloaded from
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/OMIM/genemap.
The data are loaded into an MySQL table, <TT>omimGeneMap</TT>.
<LI>The cytogenetic location data (from the location column in <TT>omimGeneMap</TT> table) are
parsed and converted into genomic start and end positions based on the <TT>cytoBand</TT> table.
These genomic positions, together with the corresponding OMIM IDs, are saved into a BED file and
loaded into table <TT>omimLocation</TT>.  All OMIM gene entries as reported in the "OMIM Genes"
track are excluded from this table. 
</UL>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
Thanks to OMIM and NCBI for the use of their data. This track was constructed by Fan Hsu,
Robert Kuhn, and Brooke Rhead of the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group.</P>
