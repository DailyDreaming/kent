<H2>Description</H2>
<P>

This track identifies alternative conserved (human-mouse) exons, as predicted by ACEScan.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>

Putative alternative conserved exons on mRNAs were identified using a machine-learning algorithm, regularized least-squares classification.  Fur further details of the method used to generate this annotation, please refer to Yeo et al (2005).
