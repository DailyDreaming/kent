This track shows the genomic alignments of exons, gene probesets,
probes, and probesets from the Affymetrix Exon array.  This array was
designed to interrogate every known and putative exon in the human
genome.  Exon data was collected from lines of evidence including
aligned mRNA and EST sequences, gene predictions, and exon
predictions.  Known and predicted exons that were supported by any of
these lines of evidence were selected for the array.  In general, this
array contains one probeset per exon.  However, whenever this
design-time evidence suggested that some exon had alternative splice
sites, the exon was subdivided into two or more regions, and one
probeset was designed for each region (where possible).  There are
many probesets on this array that do not map to any known gene.
Mostly, this reflects the large number of predicted exons in the human
genome.

<LI><I>Exons</I> represent exonic regions interrogated on the exon array, 
expected to be included or spliced out in their entirety.  
The set of exons for a single transcript
cluster are displayed together as one track entry, and identified by the 
transcript cluster ID.

<LI><I>Gene Probesets</I> represent sets of probesets that each interrogate
the same trascript cluster, grouped into a single track entry and identified
by the transcript cluster ID.

<LI><I>Probes</I> represent the oligonucleotide probes tiled on the exon array

<LI><I>Probesets</I> represent the regions interrogated by the
probesets on the exon array. These are labeled in the format
<I>transcriptID_probesetID</I>, where <I>probesetID</I>
is the Affymetrix probeset identifier and <I>transcriptID</I> 
is the Affymetrix identifier for the <I>transcript cluster</I> (or gene).
