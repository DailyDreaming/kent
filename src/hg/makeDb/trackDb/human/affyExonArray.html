<P>
This track shows the genomic alignments of exons, probesets, probes, and gene probesets from the Affymetrix Exon array.  
<UL>
<LI><I>Probesets</I> represent the regions interrogated by the probesets on
the exon array. These are labeled in the format <I>transcriptII_probesetID</I>,
where <I>transcriptID</I> represents the transcript cluster (roughy speaking: gene) and <I>probesetID</I> represents the probeset.
<LI><I>Exons</I> represent exonic regions interrogated on the exon array, 
expected to be included or spliced out in their entirety.  When design-time
evidence suggested that some exon had alternative splice sites, the exon was
subdivided into two or more exons.  The set of exons for a single transcript
cluster are displayed together as one track entry, and identified by the 
transcript cluster ID.
<LI><I>Probes</I> represent the oligonucleotide probes tiled on the exon array
<LI><I>Gene Probesets</I> represent sets of probesets that each interrogate
the same trascript cluster, grouped into a single track entry and identified
by the transcript cluster ID.
