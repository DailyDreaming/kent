<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track consolidates mutations from several locus-specific databases and one
genome-wide mutation database.
This version includes entries from the databases
listed in the Methods section below.  Work is in progress to add more 
locus-specific databases.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track is color-coded by the phenotype association or mutation type.<BR><BR>
The default colors for phenotype association are:
<UL>
<LI>
phenotype-associated = <font color="#DD0000">red</font>
<LI>
not phenotype-associated = <font color="#009900">green</font>
<LI>
likely to be phenotype-associated = <font color="#FF9900">orange</font>
<LI>
phenotype association unknown = <font color="GRAY">gray</font>
</UL>
The default colors for mutation type are:
<UL>
<LI>
substitution = <font color="#CC00FF">purple</font>
<LI>
insertion = <font color="#009900">green</font>
<LI>
duplication = <font color="#FF9900">orange</font>
<LI>
deletion = <font color="#0000FF">blue</font>
<LI>
complex = <font color="#643200">brown</font>
<LI>
unknown = black
</UL>
The color choices are configurable using the drop-down menus on the Track
Settings page.
</P>
<P>
By default, items are labeled with the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) 
name.  Additionally, the Browser can be configured to display the common name
(if available) or no label using the &quot;Label&quot; checkboxes at the 
top of the Track Settings page.</P>
<P>
All mutation types, locations, and data sources, except for the UniProt
(Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL) data source, are included in the default
display. To filter the display based on one or more of these characteristics,
check the appropriate boxes in the exclusion lists on the 
Track Settings page.

<H2>Methods</H2>

The data shown in this track were obtained from the following variant sources:
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.androgendb.mcgill.ca/" TARGET=_blank>
Androgen Receptor Gene Mutations Database</A> (ARdb) - mutations in the AR gene.

<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/mhc/xslcgi.fcgi?cmd=bgmut/home"
TARGET=_blank>Blood Group Antigen Gene Mutation Database</A> (BGMUT) -

registry for X-linked agammaglobulinemia.
<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/" TARGET=_blank>Cystic Fibrosis
Mutation Database</A> (CFMDB) - mutations in the CFTR gene.
<LI>
<A HREF="http://globin.bx.psu.edu/hbvar/menu.html" TARGET=_blank>HbVar 
database</A> - variants and thalassemia mutations in the globin loci.
<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.pahdb.mcgill.ca/" TARGET=_blank>PAHdb</A> - mutations 
in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene.
<LI>
SRD5A2 - mutations in the steroid-5-alpha-reductase, alpha polypeptide 2
(3-oxo-5 alpha-steroid delta 4-dehydrogenase alpha 2) gene.
<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.expasy.org/sprot/" TARGET=_blank>UniProt 
(Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL)</A> - 
genome-wide variants within coding regions of UCSC Known Genes.
<!--
<LI>
A possible connection with <A HREF="http://www.centralmutations.org" 
TARGET=_blank>WayStation</A>, the HGVS community-wide database.
-->
</UL>
<p>The <a href="http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/" target="_blank">
HGVS-style name</a> was pulled directly or indirectly from the source
data.  The information in this name, in combination with alignments of the
reference sequence against
the genome sequence, was used to position the variants.  The source may have
additional variants that could not be mapped to the genome.  Additional 
attributes displayed for each variant depend on the information available
from the different source databases.  If the source has web-accessible entries
for the variants, links are provided back to the source.
</p>
<p>Variants with phenotype associations that have been determined by a database
curator are listed as &quot;phenotype-associated&quot; or &quot;not 
phenotype-associated&quot;. Variants with phenotype associations that have not
been determined by a curator are listed as &quot;likely to be
phenotype-associated&quot; if they are (1) insertions, deletions, or
non-synonymous substitutions in coding regions, (2) known splicing variants,
or (3) variants that intersect with regions in the Most Conserved track. The 
phenotype association of the remaining variants is unknown.
