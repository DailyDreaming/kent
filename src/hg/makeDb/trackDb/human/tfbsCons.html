<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track contains the location and score of transcription factor
binding sites conserved in the human/mouse/rat alignment.  A binding
site is considered to be conserved across the alignment if its score
meets the threshold score for that binding site in all 3 species.
The score and threshold are computed with the Transfac Matrix Database created by
<A HREF="http://www.gene-regulation.com/pub/databases.html" TARGET=blank>Biobase</A>. 
The data are purely computational, and as such not all binding sites
listed here are biologically functional binding sites.</P>
<P>
In the graphical display, each box represents one conserved tfbs.  The
darker the box, the better the match of the binding site.  Clicking on
a box brings up detailed information on the binding site, namely its
Transfac I.D., its location in the human genome (chromosome, start, end,
and strand), its length in bases, and its score.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
A binding site is considered to be conserved across the alignment if
its score meets the threshold score for that binding site in all 3 species.
The following is a brief discussion of the scoring and threshold system
used for these data.</P>
<P>
The Transfac Matrix Database contains position-weight matrices for 
336 transcription factor binding sites, as characterized through
experimental results in the scientific literature.  A typical (in this
case fictitious) matrix will look something like:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
        A      C      G      T
01     15     15     15     15      N
02     20     10     15     15      N
03      0      0     60      0      G
04     60      0      0      0      A
05      0      0      0     60      T
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The above matrix specifies the results of 60 (the sum of each row)
experiments.  In the experiments, the first position of the binding site
was A 15 times, C 15 times, G 15 times, and T 15 times (and so on for
each position.)  The consensus sequence of the above binding site as
characterized by the matrix is NNGAT.  The format of the consensus sequence
is the deduced consensus in the IUPAC 15-letter code.</P>
<P>
The score of a segment of DNA is computed in relation to a matrix as 
follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
score = SUM over each position in the matrix of
matrix[position][nucleotide_in_segment_at_this_position].
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

For example, the sequence "CCGAT" would have a score of:
15 + 10 + 60 + 60 + 60 = 205 for the above matrix.

A score in relation to a matrix of length n can be computed for every 
DNA segment of length n.</P>

<P>
The threshold for a binding site is computed from its Transfac Matrix
Database entry as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
          St = Smin + ((Smax - Smin) * C)
                                                                               
where     St is the target threshold score
          Smin is the minimum possible score
          Smax is the maximum possible score
          C is the cutoff value used by the scoring function
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

For example, the above matrix has a minimum score of 
15 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 25 and a maximum score of 15 + 20+ 60 + 60 + 60 = 215.
Using a cutoff value of 0.85 (the value used for this track), the threshold 
for the above matrix is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
25 + ((215 - 25) * 0.85) = 186.5
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

As such the sequence "CCGAT" from above would be recorded as a hit with a 
cutoff value of 0.85, since its score (215) exceeds the threshold for this 
particular binding site (186.5.)</P>
<P>
The final score reported is the minimum cutoff value that the position would 
have been recorded as a hit (multiplied by 1000.)  The final score of the 
above example is therefore:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
((Score - Smin) / (Smax - Smin)) * 1000 = (205 - 25) / (215 - 25)) = 0.947 * 1000 = 947.
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore, the final score for the sequence "CCGAT" would be 947.
Although the scores of all three species must exceed the
threshold, the only final score that is reported for this track is the 
final score of the human sequence.</P>
<P>
These data were obtained by running the program tfloc (Transcription
Factor binding site LOCater) on multiz alignments of the Feb. 2003 mouse
draft assembly (mm3) and the Jan. 2003 rat assembly (rn2) to the Apr. 2003 human 
genome assembly (hg15.)  Tfloc was run on the subset of the Transfac Matrix
Database containing human-related binding sites (164 total.)</P>
