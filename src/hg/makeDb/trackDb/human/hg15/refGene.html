<H2>Description</H2>
The RefSeq Genes track shows known protein coding genes taken from mRNA 
reference sequences compiled at LocusLink. Coding exons are displayed 
taller than 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTR). Connecting introns 
are one-pixel lines with hatch marks indicating direction of transcription.
Non-coding RNA genes have their own track in some assemblies.
<H2>Method</H2>
Refseq mRNAs are aligned against the genome using the BLAT
program. When a single mRNA aligns in multiple places only
the best alignments are kept. The alignments must also have 
at least 96% sequence identity to be kept.
<H2>Credits</H2>
The RefSeq Genes track is produced at UCSC from mRNA sequence data
generated by scientists worldwide and curated by the 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/refseq.html">RefSeq project</A> 
at NCBI.
