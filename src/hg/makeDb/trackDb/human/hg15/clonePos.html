In dense mode, this track shows the coverage level of 
the genome.  Finished regions are shown in black. Draft regions 
are shown in various shades of gray that correspond
to the coverage.

In full mode, this track shows the position of each clone that aligns
to the genome sequence.  Finished clones are shown in black, and unfinished
clones in gray.  NOTE: Fragment positions in unfinished clones are no 
longer delineated.
