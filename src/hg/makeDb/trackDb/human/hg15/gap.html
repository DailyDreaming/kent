<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.  Most of these gaps - with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic, centromeric, telomeric, and short-arm 
gaps - have been closed during the finishing process, although a small number still remain. 
</P><P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is known, it is a 'bridged' gap. In this case, a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap, and the gap label contains the word "yes". There are 7 types of gaps:
<UL>
<LI>Fragment - gaps between the contigs of a draft clone (size varies). 
<LI>Clone - gaps between clones in the same map contig (size varies).  
<LI>Contig - gaps between map contigs (size varies). 
<LI>Heterochromatin - gaps from large blocks of heterochromatin (size varies).
<LI>Centromere - gaps from centromeres (3,000,000 N's). 
<LI>Short-arm - large gaps in the short (p) arm (size varies). 
<LI>Telomere - gaps from telomeres (size varies).
