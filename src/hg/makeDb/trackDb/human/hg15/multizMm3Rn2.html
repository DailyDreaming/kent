<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays <EM>multiz</EM> alignments of the Feb. 2003 mouse draft
assembly and the rat Jan. 2003 assembly to the human genome.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<em>Multiz</em> is a multiple alignment program that takes
blastz/axtBest alignments as input.  

<H2>Credits</H2>
<em>Multiz</em> was created by Webb Miller,
<A HREF="http://bio.cse.psu.edu/" TARGET=_blank>
Penn State Bioinformatics Group</A>. Jim Kent wrote
scripts to run multiz genome-wide and to display
the alignments in this browser.  Mouse sequence data 
is provided by the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium. 
Rat sequence data is provided by the Rat Sequencing
