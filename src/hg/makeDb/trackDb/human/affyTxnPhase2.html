<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays transcriptome data from tiling GeneChips produced
by <A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com"
TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix</A>. For the ten chromosomes 6, 7, 13, 14,
19, 20, 21, 22, X, and Y, more than 74 million probes were tiled every
5 bp in non-repeat-masked areas and hybridized to mRNA from 11
different cell lines (some cell lines were female and contain no data
for chrY). For HepG2 there are samples which are depleted
of polyA transcripts rather than enriched. For experimental details
and results, see Cheng <em>et al</em>. in the References section
below.  <br> <CENTER><img src='../images/affyTxn2Example.jpg'></CENTER>
<P>
The track is colored blue in areas that are thought to be transcribed
at a statistically significant level as described in the accompanying
transfrags (transcribed fragments) track. Transfrags that have a
significant blat hit elsewhere in the genome are displayed in a
lighter shade of blue, and transfrags that overlap putative
pseudogenes are colored an even lighter shade of blue. All other
regions of the track are colored brown. While the raw data are based
on prefect match minus mismatch probe (PM - MM) values and may contain
negative values, the track has a minimum value of zero for visualization
purposes.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
For each data point, probes within 30 bp on either side were used to
improve the estimate of expression level for a particular probe. This
helps to smooth the data and produce a more robust estimate of the
transcription level at a particular genomic location. The following
analysis method was used:
<UL>
<LI>Replicate arrays were quantile-normalized and the median
intensity (using both PM and MM intensities) of each array was
scaled to a target value of 44.
<LI>The expression level was estimated for each mapped probe position by 
  <UL>
  <LI>collecting all the probe pairs that fell within a window of &#177
  30 bp.

  <LI>calculating all non-redundant pairwise averages of PM - MM
  values of all probe pairs in the window.

  <LI>taking the median of all resulting pairwise averages.
  </UL>
<LI>The resulting signal value is the Hodges-Lehmann estimator
associated with the Wilcoxon signed-rank statistic of the PM - MM
values that lie within &#177 30 bp of the sliding window centered at
every genomic coordinate.
