<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The FOX2 CLIP-seq track shows adaptor-trimmed CLIP-seq reads that mapped
uniquely to the repeat-masked human genome (hg17).  The reads were converted 
to hg18 coordinates using the UCSC LiftOver tool.  Reads on the forward 
strand are displayed in blue; those on the reverse strand are shown in red.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Cross-linking immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput
sequencing (CLIP-seq) of cell type-specific splicing regulator FOX2
(also known as RBM9) was performed in human embryonic stem cells.
MosaikAligner was utilized to align the reads to the repeat-masked
genome.

Briefly, HUES6 human embryonic stem cells were treated with UV irradiation to 
stabilize in vivo protein-RNA interactions, followed by antibody-mediated 
precipitation of specific RNA-protein complexes.  SDS-PAGE was then utilized 
to isolate protein-RNA adducts after RNA trimming with nuclease, 3'RNA linkers 
were ligated, and nucleotides were 5' end labeled with P32-gamma ATP.  
Recovered RNA was ligated to a 5' linker before amplification by RT-PCR.  
Both linkers were designed to be compatible with Illumina 1G genome analyzer 
sequencing.  Approximately 4 million reads were uniquely mapped to the 
repeat-masked human genome by MosaikAligner.

To identify CLIP clusters, we performed the following steps: (i) CLIP reads
were associated with protein-coding genes as defined by the region from the
annotated transcriptional start to the end of each gene locus. (ii) CLIP reads
were separated into the categories of sense or antisense to the transcriptional
direction of the gene. (ii) Sense CLIP reads were extended by 100 nt in the
5'-to-3' direction. The height of each nucleotide position is the number of
reads that overlap that position. (iv) The count distribution of heights is as
follows from 1, 2, ...h, ...H-1, H: {n1, n2, ...nh, ...nH-1,nH; N = Sigma ni
(i = 1:H)}. For a particular height, h, the associated probability of observing
a height of at least h is Ph = Sigma ni (i = h:H) / N. (v) We computed the
background frequency after randomly placing the same number of extended reads
within the gene for 100 iterations. This controls for the length of the gene
and the number of reads. For each iteration, the count distribution and
probabilities for the randomly placed reads (Ph,random) was generated as in
step (iv). (vi) Our modified FDR for a peak height was computed as FDR(h) =
(muh + sigmah)/Ph, where muh and sigmah is the average and s.d., respectively,
of Ph,random across the 100 iterations. For each gene loci, we chose a
threshold peak height h* as the smallest height equivalent to FDR(h*) < 0.001.
We identified FOX2 binding clusters by grouping nucleotide positions satisfying
h > h* and occurred within 50 nt of each other.
