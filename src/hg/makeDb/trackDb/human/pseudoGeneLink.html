<H2>Description</H2>
The retroGene track shows processed mRNAs that have been inserted back 
into the genome since the mouse/human split. RetroGenes can be either 
functional genes that have acquired a promoter from a neighboring gene, 
non-functional pseudogenes, or transcribed pseudogenes.

<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>
All mRNAs of a species from GenBank were aligned to the genome using 
<A HREF="http://bio.cse.psu.edu/dist/blastz.pdf" TARGET=_blank>Blastz</A>. 
mRNAs that aligned twice in the genome (once with introns and once without 
introns) were initially screened. Next, a series of features were scored to 
determine candidates for retrotranspostion events. These features include
position and length of the polyA tail, degree of synteny with mouse, coverage 
of repetitive elements, number of exons that can still be aligned to the 
retroGene and degree of divergence from the parent gene.  These features are 
combined heuristic weighting based on analysis of known processed pseudogenes.
RetroGenes in the final set have a score threshold greater than 425 based on a 
ROC plot against the Vega annotated pseudogenes.

The "type" field has four possible values: 
<UL> <LI><EM>singleExon</EM> indicates that the parent gene is a single exon gene.
</LI>
 <LI><EM>mrna</EM> indicates that the parent gene is a spliced mrna that 
has no annotation in NCBI refSeq, UCSC knownGene or Mammalian Gene Collection 
(MGC).</LI>
  <LI><EM>annotated</EM> indicates that the parent gene has been annotated
by one of refSeq, knownGene or MGC.</LI>
  <LI><EM>expressed</EM> indicates that there is a mrna overlapping 
the retrogene, indicating probable transcription.</LI></UL>
These features can be downloaded from the table pseudoGeneLink in many 
formats using the Table Browser option on the blue bar.
