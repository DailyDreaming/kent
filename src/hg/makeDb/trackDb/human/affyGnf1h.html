<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the location of the sequences used for the selection of 
probes on the Affymetrix GNF1H chips. This contains 11406 predicted genes 
that do not overlap with the Affy U133A chip.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The sequences were mapped to the genome using blat followed by pslReps with 
the parameters:<PRE><TT>   -minCover=0.3 -minAli=0.95 -nearTop=0.005
</TT></PRE></P>
