<H2>Description</H2> 
<P> 
<A HREF="http://www.hapmap.org" TARGET=_blank>The HapMap Project</A>
identified a set of approximately four million
common SNPs, and genotyped these SNPs in four populations.
The intent is that this data can be used as a reference for future studies
of human disease. This track displays the genotype counts and allele
frequencies of those SNPs. The data displayed are from release 21a (HapMap 
Phase II), based on 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/index.html" TARGET=_blank>dbSNP</A>
build 125.   This track also provides orthologous alleles from chimp and 
macaque.
</P>
<P>
The HapMap data are from these four human populations:
<UL>
<LI>Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (abbreviation: YRI)</LI>
<LI>Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (abbreviation: JPT)</LI>
<LI>Han Chinese in Beijing, China (abbreviation: CHB)</LI>
<LI>CEPH (Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe) (abbreviation: CEU)</LI>
</UL>
Each of the populations is displayed in a separate subtrack.
</P>
<P>
The CEU and YRI data are comprised of 90 individuals in parent-child trios. The UCSC display
removes the data for the children, leaving 60 individuals in each population.
The CHB and JPT data are comprised of 45 individuals. Over 12% of HapMap SNPs
are available for only a subset (1-3) of the populations. When 
available, the CHB and JPT SNPs were assayed in a minimum of 18 individuals,
with over 97% of SNPs assayed in 45 or more individuals. The minimums for CEU
and YRI are 26 and 24 respectively, with over 94% of SNPs assayed in 55 or more
individuals.
</P>
<P>
The HapMap assays provide biallelic results. Over 99.9% of HapMap SNPs are
included in dbSNP build125 as biallelic; approximately 3,000 are more complex.
Two-thirds of the HapMap SNPs are transitions: one-third are A/G, one-third
are C/T.
</P>
<P>
The orthologous alleles in chimp (panTro2) and macaque (rheMac2) 
were derived using 
<A HREF="http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#Convert">liftOver</A>.
Chimp alleles are available for over 96% 
of the human HapMap SNPs; macaque alleles are available for 88%.
</P>
<P>
15% of HapMap SNPs are monomorphic in all individuals in all populations.
Within single populations, monomorphism ranged from 21.5% of the YRI
individuals to 38% of the JPT individuals.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 20% of HapMap SNPs have a different major allele in different
populations.
</P>
<P>
No two HapMap SNPs occupy the same position. Aside from seven SNPs from the 
pseudo
autosomal region of chrX, no rsIds are included more than once. No HapMap SNPs
occur on chrM or on "random" chromosomes.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The human SNPs are displayed using a color gradient based on minor allele
frequency. The higher the minor allele frequency, the darker the display. 
By definition, the maximum minor allele frequency is 50%. 
When zoomed to base level, the major allele is displayed for each population. 
</P>
<P>
Reversing the base position track will cause the HapMap display to reverse as
well. This is the recommended configuration for SNPs on the negative strand.
</P>
<P>
The orthologous alleles from chimp and macaque are displayed using a color 
gradient based on quality score.
Quality scores range from 0 to 100 representing low to high quality. For 
orthologous alleles, the higher the quality, the darker the display. Quality 
scores are not available for chimp chromosomes chr21 and chrY.
</P>
<P>
Filters are provided for the data attributes described above. Additionally,
a filter is provided for heterozgosity over all populations. The measure of
heterozygosity used is 2pq (from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium). 
Filters are applied to all six subtracks, even
if a subtrack is not displayed.
