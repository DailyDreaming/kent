Strand issues can be rather confusing here, so it's nice to clarify
the strand usage in advance.  In these files, the strand has already
been accounted for the human alleles can be compared to the chimp
nucleotide directly.  Also, the strand info is the same between the
genotype data and the new files.  To help me explain the situation
clearly, I'm using a real from hg16 example to illustrate.

  # This example shows the two human bases ('T' and 'A') and the chimp allele ('a')
  name      humanChrom humanPos  hStrand hRef hOth chimpChrom chimpPos  cStrand cAllele
  rs4970776 chr1       109570184 +       T    A    chr1       112470519 -       a

From this point, the SNP is marked the SNP with a caret ('^'), and the
flanking sequences are included.  Also note the revComp state, which
is an indicator of the strand.  (The 'DNA' button at the top of the
Genome Browser browser will provide the DNA directly.)

  Assembly  chr   pos         strand   range (+/- 5 bp)
  hg16      chr1  109570184   +        chr1:109570179-109570189
  panTro1   chr1  112470519   -        chr1:112470514-112470524

  >hg16_dna range=chr1:109570179-109570189 revComp=FALSE
  TTCAGTGGCTT                                      ^^^^^  ==> '+' strand
       ^   ==> 'T' is the reference allele

  >panTro1_dna range=chr1:112470514-112470524 revComp=FALSE  (needs to be reverse complemented to see '-' strand)
  AAGCCTCTGAA
  >panTro1_dna range=chr1:112470514-112470524 revComp=TRUE
  TTCAGAGGCTT                                         ^^^^  ==> '-' strand
       ^   ==> 'A' is the orthologous base in chimp

This means that the 'A' allele is shared between chimp and humans.
Without additional outgroup information, the term 'ancestral' is a bit
premature here.

As input I used the genotype data directly from the release 16b
allele_freq* files and have not processed it (strand flipping)
further, the human alleles in my output should be the same as the
reported genotype data.
