<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This track shows expression data from the Gladstone Institute. 
In full mode all tissues are
displayed.  In packed or dense mode averages of related tissues are shown.
As is standard with microarray data red indicates overexpression in the 
tissue, and green indicates underexpression.   You may want to view gene
expression with the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/hgNear">Gene Sorter</A> as 
well as the Genome Browser.</P>

<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>For detailed information about the experiments, see
Abeyta M.J. et al. (2004),
<A HREF="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/13/6/601" 
TARGET=_blank>Unique gene expression signatures of independently-derived human embryonic stem cell lines</A>, 
Hum. Mol. Gen. 13(6):601-608.
<P>When calculating expression ratios, the overall expression level in the
denominator was calculated by first taking the median of replicants for
each tissue,  and then taking the median of these medians.
