<H2>Consensus Pseudogenes</H2>
<H3>Description</H3>
<P>
This track shows pseudogenes derived from a consensus of five different 
methods (Yale Pipeline, GenCode manual annotation, two different UCSC 
methods, and Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS)). 201 consensus pseudogenes 
were found in January 2006 freeze. In this analysis, pseudogenes are defined 
as genomic sequences that are similar to known genes but with various 
inactivating disablements (<em>e.g.</em> premature stop codons or 
frameshifts) in their putative protein-coding regions and are flagged as 
either recently-processed or non-processed.</P>
<P>
<H3>Methods</H3>
Sets of pseudogenes were obtained from four research groups&mdash;GIS, 
Havana/Gencode, UCSC, and Yale&mdash;and were processed as follows:
<UL>
<LI><B>Step I:</B> The four data sets were filtered to remove pseudogenes 
that overlap with current Gencode coding exons/loci. Pseudogenes overlapping 
with introns or noncoding genes were kept. Subsequent filtering of pseudogene
sets, excluding the Havana set, removed pseudogenes overlapping with exons of 
UCSC Known Genes.

<LI><B>Step II:</B> A union of the pseudogenes from each filtered set was 
created. If a pseudogenic region was annotated by more than one group, 
the lowest starting coordinate and highest ending coordinate were used as the
boundaries.

<LI><B>Step III:</B> A parent protein for each pseudogene in the union was
assigned using a protein set from UniProt. Pseudogenes without a matching 
protein were excluded.

<LI><B>Step IV:</B> Each pseudogene was realigned to its parent protein.

<LI><B>Step V:</B> The consensus list of pseudogenes was updated with 
boundaries derived from the alignment in Step IV.

<LI><B>Step VI:</B> The consensus list of pseudogenes was updated with the
assigned parent proteins and new classifications (processed or non-processed).

<H2>Yale Pseudogenes</H2>
<H3>Description</H3>
This subtrack shows pseudogenes identified by the Yale Pseudogene Pipeline in 
the ENCODE regions.  Pseudogenes are defined in this analysis as genomic 
sequences that are similar to known genes with various inactivating 
disablements (e.g. premature stop codons or frameshifts) in their "putative" 
protein coding regions. Pseudogenes are flagged as either recently processed, 
recently duplicated, or of uncertain origin (either ancient fragments or 
resulting from a single-exon parent).
<H3>Methods</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>Step I:</B> Repeat-masked human genome sequence was used as the target 
for a six-frame TBLASTN where the query was the nonredundant human proteome 
set (European Bioinformatics Institute). Only high quality human protein 
sequences from SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL were used as this set included processed 
or duplicated pseudogenes.
<LI><B>Step II:</B> BLAST hits that had a significant overlap with annotated
multiple-exon Ensembl genes were removed from consideration.
<LI><B>Step III:</B> The set of BLAST hits was reduced by selecting hits in 
decreasing significance level and removing matches that overlapped by more
than 10 amino acids or 30 bp with a picked match.
<LI><B>Step IV:</B> Adjacent matches on a chromosome were merged together if 
they were thought to belong to the same pseudogene locus. Merged matches were
extended on both sides to equal the length of the query protein to which they 
matched plus an extra 30 bp buffer on either side. 
<LI><B>Step V:</B> The FASTA program was used to re-align these extended hits to the genome. Redundant hits were removed and hits with gaps greater than 60 bp
were split into two alignments.
<LI><B>Step VI:</B> Alignments with possible artifactual frameshifts or stop 
codons introduced by the alignment process were closely inspected.
<LI><B>Step VII:</B> False positives (E-value less than 10<SUP>-10</SUP> or 
amino acid sequence of less than 40% identity) and sequences matching to 
protein queries containing repeats or low complexity regions were removed. 
Potential functional genes were also removed. These were defined as having no 
frameshift disruptions, less than 95% sequence identity to the query protein, 
and can be translated to a protein sequence longer than 95% of the length of 
the query protein.
<LI><B>Step VIII:</B> The remaining putative pseudogene sequences were 
classified based on a number of criteria. The intron-exon structure of the 
functional gene was further used to infer whether a pseudogene was recently 
duplicated or processed. A duplicated pseudogene retains the intron-exon 
structure of its parent functional gene, whereas a processed pseudogene shows 
evidence that this structure has been spliced out. Those sequences
where the insertions were 50% or more repeats (as detected by RepeatMasker)
are "Disrupted" processed pseudogenes. Small pseudogene sequences that 
cannot be confidently assigned to either the processed or duplicated 
category may be ancient fragments. Further details are in the references below.

<H2>UCSC Retrogene Predictions</H2>
<H3>Description</H3>
<P>
The retroGene track shows processed mRNAs that have been inserted back 
into the genome since the mouse/human split. RetroGenes can be either 
functional genes that have acquired a promoter from a neighboring gene, 
non-functional pseudogenes, or transcribed pseudogenes.</P>

<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>
All mRNAs of a species from GenBank were aligned to the genome using blastz. 
mRNAs that aligned twice in the genome (once with introns and once without 
introns) were initially screened. Next, a series of features were scored to 
determine candidates for retrotranspostion events. These features include
position and length of the polyA tail, degree of synteny with mouse, coverage 
of repetitive elements, number of exons that can still be aligned to the 
retroGene and degree of divergence from the parent gene.  These features are 
combined heuristic weighting based on analysis of known processed pseudogenes.
RetroGenes in the final set have a score threshold greater than 425 based on a
ROC plot against the Vega annotated pseudogenes.
<P>
The "type" field has four possible values: 
<UL>
<LI><EM>singleExon</EM> indicates that the parent gene is a single exon gene.
</LI>
<LI><EM>mrna</EM> indicates that the parent gene is a spliced mrna that 
has no annotation in NCBI refSeq, UCSC knownGene or Mammalian Gene Collection 
(MGC).</LI>
<LI><EM>annotated</EM> indicates that the parent gene has been annotated
by one of refSeq, knownGene or MGC.</LI>
<LI><EM>expressed</EM> indicates that there is a mrna overlapping 
the retrogene, indicating probable transcription.</LI></UL>
These features can be downloaded from the table pseudoGeneLink in many 
formats using the Table Browser option on the blue bar. </P>

<H2>UCSC Pseudogene Predictions</H2>
<H3>Methods</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>Step I:</B>A set of pre-aligned human known genes was mapped across the 
human genome through the human Blastz Self Alignment using HomoMap (homologous 
mapping method). The fragments identified by HomoMap are homologs of genes 
from the Known Genes set. 

<LI><B>Step II:</B>Each homologous fragment was compared with its 
known reference gene and then a set of features were collected. The features
included sequence identity, Ka/Ks ratio (asynonymous substitution per codon vs 
synonymous substitution per codon), splicing sites, and the number of 
premature stop codons. These homologous fragments are either genes or 
pseudogenes. 

<LI><B>Step III:</B> Homologous fragments that overlapped known reference 
genes were labeled as positive samples and those overlapping known pseudogenes 
were labeled as negative samples. 

<LI><B>Step IV:</B> These positive and negative sets were used to train 
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to separate coding fragments from pseudo
fragments. The trained SVMs were used to classify all homologous fragments
into potential coding elements or potential pseudo elements. 

<LI><B>Step V:</B> Finally, a heuristic filter was used to correct some 
misclassified fragments and to generate the final potential pseudogene set.

<H2>GIS-PET Pseudogene Predictions</H2>
<H3>Methods</H3>
<H3>Description</H3>
This track shows retrotransposed pseudogenes predicted by multiple mapped 
GIS-PET (Gene identification signature-pair end ditag) collected from two 
different cancer cell lines HCT116 and MCF7.  A total of 49 non-redundant 
processed pseudogenes predicted in the ENCODE regions are presented in this 
track.  Each pseudogene has an ID with this format: AAA-GISPgene-XX. 
The AAA indicates the parental gene name, GISPgene is GIS pseudogene and XX 
is the unique ID for each pseudogene. 

<H3>Methods</H3>
Pair-end ditags were generated from full length transcripts and 
computationally mapped onto the human genome to demarcate the transcript start 
and end positions. The PETs that mapped to multiple genome locations were 
grouped into PET-based gene families which include parent gene and 
pseudogenes.  A representative member was selected from each family which
was the shortest PET as defined by genomic coordinates. This representative
PET was aligned to the hg17 genome using in order to identify all the 
putative pseudogenes at the whole genome level.  All hits with an 
identity >= 70% and coverage >= 50% within ENCODE regions were reported.
Coverage refers to alignment coverage of the query sequence, so it is a 
measure of how complete the predicted pseudogene is relative to the query 
sequence.

<H3>Verification</H3>
Pseudogenes were verified by manual examination.
