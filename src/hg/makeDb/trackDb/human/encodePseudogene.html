<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows pseudogenes in the ENCODE regions derived from taking a
consensus of 5 different methods (Yale Pipeline, GenCode manual annotation, 
two different UCSC methods, and GIS). This is the 6-Jan-2006 Freeze and 
contains 201 consensus pseudogenes. Pseudogenes are defined in this analysis 
as genomic sequences that are similar to known proteins with various 
inactivating disablements ( e.g. premature stop codons or frameshifts) in 
their "putative" protein coding regions. Pseudogenes are flagged as either 
recently processed or non-processed.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
We started with lists of pseudogenes from four research groups: GIS, 
HAVANA/GENCODE, UCSC, and Yale .

Roughly, we followed the outlined below:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Step I:</B> The above lists were filtered to remove pseudogenes that 
overlap with current GENCODE coding exons/loci. Pseudogenes overlapping with 
introns or noncoding genes were kept. Subsequent filtering of pseudogenes 
removed those overlapping with exons of Known Genes (except for the HAVANA 
list).

<LI><B>Step II:</B> A union of the pseudogenes from each filtered list was 
created. If a pseudogenic region was annotated by more than one group, the 
boundary represented the smallest start and the largest end.

<LI><B>Step III:</B> A parent protein for each pseudogene in the union was
assigned using a protein set from UniProt. Pseudogenes without a matching 
protein were excluded.

<LI><B>Step IV:</B> Each pseudogene was then re-aligned to its parent protein.

<LI><B>Step V:</B> The consensus list of pseudogenes was updated with 
boundaries derived from the alignment in Step IV.

<LI><B>Step VI:</B> The consensus list of pseudogenes was updated with their
assigned parent proteins and new classification (processed or non-processed).

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
All pseudogenes in the list have been extensively curated by Adam Frankish and
Jenifer Harrow at the The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
These data were generated by the ENCODE pseudogene annotation group.
