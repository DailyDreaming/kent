<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows unique regions in the genome, as identified by the genomic 
alignment of 35-nucleotide segments.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Stepping across the entire genome in 1-nucleotide steps, we generated sequence
'tiles' of 35 nucleotides in length.  We aligned each tile to the genome
using the BWA aligner.  If a tile aligns uniquely and perfectly in hg18, 
BWA assigns it a p-value of 1e-37. If it aligns uniquely in multiple locations,
BWA assigns it a p-value of 0.  For each tile, we recorded the oligo mid-point
coordinate and the -log_10 p-value: 37 (unambiguous) to 0 (ambiguous).
