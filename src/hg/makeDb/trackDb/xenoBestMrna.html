<H2> Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays translated blat alignments of
non-$organism vertebrate mRNA from Genbank.  </P>

<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
The alignments were passed through a near-best-in-genome filter.</P>

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>The track filter can be used to color, include, or exclude a subset of individual 
items within a track. This is helpful when many items are shown in the track
display, especially when only some are relevant to the current task. To use the
filter:
<OL>
<LI>Enter a value in one or more of the text boxes to filter the mRNA display. For
example, to apply the filter to all brain mRNAs, type &quot;brain&quot; in the 
tissue box. For a list of permissible filter values, consult the non-positional table in
the Table Browser that corresponds to the factor on which you wish to filter. For
example, the non-positional table &quot;tissue&quot; contains all of the types of tissues
that can be entered into the tissue text box. Wildcards can also be used in the
filter.
<LI>If filtering on more than one value, choose the desired combination
logic. If &quot;and&quot; is selected, only mRNAs that match all of the filter criteria will
be highlighted. If &quot;or&quot; is selected, mRNAs that match any 1 of the filter criteria
will be highlighted.
<LI>Choose the color or display characteristic that will be used to highlight or
include/exclude the filtered items. If &quot;exclude&quot; is chosen, the browser will not 
display mRNAs that match the filter criteria. If &quot;include&quot; is selected, the browser 
will display only those mRNAs that match the filter criteria.
</OL></P>
<P>
When you are finished configuring the filter, click the <em>Submit</em> button.</P>
