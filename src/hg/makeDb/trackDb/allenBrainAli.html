<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) created a platform for high-throughput in situ hybridization (ISH) that allows a highly systematic approach to analyzing gene expression in the brain. In situ hybridization is a technique that allows the cellular localization of mRNA transcripts for specific genes. Labeled antisense probes, specific to a particular gene, are hybridized to cellular (sense) transcripts and subsequent detection of the bound probe produces specific labeling in those cells expressing the particular gene. This method involves tagged nucleotides detected using immunocytochemical methods.</P>

<P>The platform used for the ABA utilizes this non-isotopic approach, with digoxigenin-labeled nucleotides incorporated into a riboprobe produced by in vitro transcription. This method produces a label that fills the cell body, in contrast to autoradiography that produces scattered silver grains surrounding each labeled cell. To enhance the ability to detect low level expression, the ABA has incorporated a tyramide signal amplification step into the protocol that greatly increases sensitivity. The specific methodology is described in detail within the <A HREF="http://www.brain-map.org/pdf/ABADataProductionProcesses.pdf" TARGET=_blank>ABA Data Production Processes document</A>.</P>
