<H2>Description</H2>

<P>This region was detected as a putative genomic duplication within the golden path.
     Orange, yellow, dark-light gray represent similarities of >99\%, 99-98\% and 98-90% 
     respectively. Duplications greater than 98% similarity that lack sufficient SDD 
     evidence (likely missed overlaps) are shown as red.Cut off values were at least 
     1 kb of total sequence aligned (containing at least 500 bp non-RepeatMasked sequence) 
     and at least 90% sequence identity. For a description of the 'fuguization' detection 
     method see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11381028&dopt=Abstract">Bailey, <i>et al</i> (2001) Genome Res 11:1005-17</a>.
