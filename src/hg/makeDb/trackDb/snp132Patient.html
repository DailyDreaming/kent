<H2>Description</H2>

<P>
This track contains information about a subset of the 
single nucleotide polymorphisms
and small insertions and deletions (indels) &mdash; collectively Simple
Nucleotide Polymorphisms &mdash; from
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" target=_blank>dbSNP</A>
build 132, available from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms" target=_blank>ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp</A>.
Only SNPs flagged as clinically associated by dbSNP, 
mapped to a single location in the reference genome assembly, and 
<em>not</em> known to have a minor allele frequency of at 
least 1%, are included in this subset.
Frequency data are not available for all SNPs, so this subset may
include some SNPs whose true minor allele frequency is 1% or greater.
