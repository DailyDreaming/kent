<H2>Description</H2>
The GC percent track shows the percentage of G (guanine) and C (cytosine) bases
in a 20,000 base window.  High GC content is typically associated with
gene-rich areas.

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>The track filter can be used to configure display attributes of
the track's graph. 
<UL>
<LI><B>Type of graph</B>: The default &quot;Bar&quot; setting depicts the graph
data using color-filled bars. To view the data as a series of points or lines, 
select the &quot;Points&quot; setting. 
<LI><B>y = 0.0 line</B>: Select the &quot;ON&quot; setting to display a
line marking the 0.0 position on the graph (default is &quot;OFF&quot;).
<LI><B>Track height</B>: To change the default display height of the graph
in pixels, type in a value from within the indicated range.
<LI><B>Vertical viewing range</B>: The min and max values specify the 
vertical portion of the graph that is displayed (default
range is 30-70). These numbers can be used to set data threshold indicators. 
For example, to display only those GC values greater than 50 percent, set the 
min value to &quot;50&quot;.
<LI><B>Data view scaling</B>: The default &quot;Use vertical viewing range
setting&quot; option displays the data using the parameters specified in the Vertical
viewing range setting. To configure the graph to automatically scale to a
range defined by the minimum and maximum data points in the current 
view, select the &quot;Auto-scale to data view&quot; option. 
<LI><B>Windowing function</B>: When a  view is too large to show individual
data values, the values must be combined to produce a plot point.
This option specifies the combining function to be used: &quot;Maximim&quot; - 
the maximum value of all the points to be combined, &quot;Mean&quot; - 
the mean, or &quot;Minimum&quot; - the minimum of all the
points to be combined (default is &quot;Mean&quot;).
<LI><B>Smoothing window</B>: When set to a numerical value, this option 
determines the size, in pixels, of a smoothing window
to be passed over the plot to smooth the edges of the bars or lines.  
This is equivalent to a trend line calculation on the graph.
The default setting is &quot;OFF&quot;.
<LI><B>Draw indicator line at y=</B>: When set to &quot;ON&quot;, the track
displays an arbitrary line on the graph at the specified numerical value 
(defaults are &quot;0&quot; and &quot;OFF&quot;). This line can be used to 
mark a significant threshold on the graph.
