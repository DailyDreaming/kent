<H2>Description</H2>
The GC percent track shows the percentage of G (guanine) and C (cytosine) bases
in a 20,000 base window.  High GC content is typically associated with
gene-rich areas.

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>The track filter can be used to configure display attributes of
the track's graph. 
<UL>
<LI><B>Type of graph</B>: The default &quot;Bar&quot; setting depicts the graph
data using filled-in bars. To switch to a view in which the data are
represented by points or lines,
select the 
&quot;Points&quot; setting. 
<LI><B>y = 0.0 line</B>: Select the &quot;ON&quot; setting to display a
line marking the 0.0 position on the graph (default is &quot;OFF&quot;).
<LI><B>Track height</B>: To change the default display height of the graph
in pixels, type in a value between 11 and 128
(the default display height is 36 pixels).
<LI><B>Vertical viewing range</B>: By default, the viewing range is set to
the values of min: 30, max: 70.  Change these values to move this view
window over the data.  Can be used as a threshold indicator, for example,
enter a minimum value of 50 to view GC percent values only above 50%.
<LI><B>Data view scaling</B>: The default &quot;Use Vertical Viewing Range
Setting" displays the data using the parameters specified in the Vertical
viewing range setting.  To configure the graph to automatically scale to a
range defined by the minimum and maximum data points in the current 
view, select the &quot;Auto-Scale to data view&quot; option. 
<LI><B>Windowing function</B>: At views that are too large to show individual
data values, the data values must be combined to produce a plot point.
This option selects the combining function.  <em> Maximim </em> will select
the maximum value of all the points to be combined, <em> Mean </em>
selects the mean, <em> Minimum </em> selects the minimum of all the
points to be combined.
<LI><B>Smoothing window</B>: Sets the size, in pixels, of a smoothing window
to be passed over the plot.  Can be used to smooth the edges of the
bar plot.  This is equivalent to a trend line calculation on the graph.
<LI><B>Draw indicator line at y=</B>: Draw an arbitrary line on the
graph at the selected value.  Can be used to indicate a significant threshold
on the graph.
