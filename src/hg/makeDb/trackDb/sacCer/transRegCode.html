<H2>Description</H2> 

<P>This track shows regulatory elements in <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I>
supported by experimental and/or computational evidence (Harbison, Gordon,
et al., 2004).  Harbison, Gordon, et al. performed a genome-wide location
analysis with 203 known DNA-binding transcriptional regulators (some under
multiple environmental conditions), and identified 11,000 high-confidence
interactions between regulators and promoter regions.  They then compiled a
compendium of motifs for 102 transcriptional regulators based on a
combination of their experimental results, cross-species conservation data
on four species of yeast, and motifs from the literature, and mapped these
motifs to the <I>S. cerevisiae</I> genome.</P>

<P>The details page shows the sequence at a putative binding site compared to
the position-specific probability matrix for the identified transcriptional
regulator.  It also indicates whether the the binding site is supported by
experimental (CHIP/CHIP) data and the number of other species of yeast in
which the motif is conserved.</P

The data for this track was provided by the Young and Fraenkel labs at
MIT/Whitehead/Broad.  The track was designed by Jim Kent.
