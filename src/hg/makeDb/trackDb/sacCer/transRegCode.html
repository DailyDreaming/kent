<H2>Description</H2> 

<P>This track shows putative regulatory elements in <I>Saccharomyces
cerevisiae</I> that are supported by cross-species evidence (Harbison,
Gordon, et al., 2004).  Harbison, Gordon, et al. performed a genome-wide
location analysis with 203 known DNA-binding transcriptional regulators
(some under multiple environmental conditions), and identified 11,000
high-confidence interactions between regulators and promoter regions.  They
then compiled a compendium of motifs for 102 transcriptional regulators
based on a combination of their experimental results, cross-species
conservation data for four species of yeast, and motifs from the
literature, and finally, they mapped these motifs to the
<I>S. cerevisiae</I> genome.  This track shows positions at which these
motifs matched the genome with high confidence and at which the
matching sequence was well conserved across yeast species. </P>

<P>The details page for each putative binding site shows the sequence at
that site compared to the position-specific probability matrix for the
associated transcriptional regulator (shown as both a table and a graphical
logo).  It also indicates whether the the binding site is supported by
experimental (CHIP/CHIP) results and the number of other yeast species in
which it is conserved.</P>

<P>See also the "Reg. CHIP/CHIP" track for additional related information.</P>

The data for this track was provided by the Young and Fraenkel labs at
MIT/Whitehead/Broad.  The track was created by Jim Kent.
