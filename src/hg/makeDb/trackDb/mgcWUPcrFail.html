This track includes predicted transcripts on which experiments were
performed but which failed.  Failure can mean either no amplicon was
produced or that the amplicon did not splice align to the genomic region
of the intended target structure. Est2Genome is used for alignment.
Generally parameters are set such that splice_penalty=15,
intron_penalty=30, mismatch=3, minscore=20, and gap_penalty=4. A FAIL is
determined if any one of the following criteria isn't met, the alignment
has at least one splice, has an overall identity over 75%, at least 60%
of the segments in the alignment have 80% identity to the genome, and
the terminal exons are at least length 10. The track items consist of
the sequence sequenced between the chosen primers.
