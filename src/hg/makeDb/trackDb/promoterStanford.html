<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The Stanford Human Promoters dataset was generated by
<a href="http://www-shgc.stanford.edu/myerslab/">Rick Myers' Lab</a>
at Stanford University and is described thoroughly in
<a href="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/short/13/2/308">
"Identification and Functional Analysis of Human
Transcriptional Promoters."</a>
<p>Briefly, Full-length human cDNAs were aligned to the human genome
sequence to predict putative starts of transcription.  Roughly 500 bp
of putative promoter sequence was then cloned into a reporter
construct for 150 random promoters.  More than 90% of these fragments
had significant promoter activity in at least one of the cell types
we tested.
<p>The promoters highlighted in black have been experimentally confirmed as functional promoters, and the ones highlighted in gray are predicted and are in the process of being tested.
