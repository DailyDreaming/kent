Gene predictions from <A HREF="http://www.ensembl.org" TARGET=_blank>Ensembl</A> 
based on ESTs.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
ESTs were mapped onto the genome using a combination of Exonerate, Blast and 
Est_Genome, with a threshold defined as an overall percentage identity of 90 and 
at least one exon having a percentage identity of 97 or higher. The results were 
processed by merging the redundant ESTs and setting splice sites to the most 
common ends, resulting in alternative spliced forms. This evidence was processed 
by Genomewise, which finds the longest ORF and assigns 5' and 3' UTRs.
