<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
  This track shows <i>ab initio</i> predictions from the program
  <a href="http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus/" target="_blank">AUGUSTUS</a> (version 3.1).
  The predictions are based on the genome sequence alone.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
Statistical signal models were built for splice sites, branch-point
patterns, translation start sites, and the poly-A signal.
Furthermore, models were built for the sequence content of
protein-coding and non-coding regions as well as for the length distributions
of different exon and intron types. Detailed descriptions of most of these different models
can be found in Mario Stanke's

The track shows the most likely gene structure according to a
Semi-Markov Conditional Random Field model.
Alternative splicing transcripts were obtained with
a sampling algorithm (<tt>--alternatives-from-sampling=true --sample=100 --minexonintronprob=0.2
--minmeanexonintronprob=0.5 --maxtracks=3 --temperature=2</tt>).
</p>

<p>
Predictions for fish species were created with the <tt>zebrafish</tt> version of AUGUSTUS.
Predictions for bird species with the <tt>chicken</tt> version.
Predictions for all other vertebrate species with the <tt>human</tt>
version. In each case, the parameters of the models were
estimated beforehand using 1000-2000 training gene structures.

for providing the AUGUSTUS program.  The training for the <tt>chicken</tt> version was
done by Stefanie K&ouml;nig and the training for the
<tt>human</tt> and <tt>zebrafish</tt> versions was done by Mario Stanke.
