<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
  This track shows <i>ab initio</i> predictions from the program
  <a href="http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus/" target="_blank">AUGUSTUS</a> (version 3.1).
  The predictions are based on the genome sequence alone.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
Statistical signal models were built for splice site and branch-point
patterns, the translation start site and in case of UTR predictions
also for the poly-A signal. Further, sequence content models for
protein-coding and non-coding regions and length distributions for
different exons types and introns were built. The majority of models
is as described in the 
<a href="http://hdl.handle.net/11858/00-1735-0000-0006-B3F8-4" target="_blank">dissertation of Mario Stanke</a>.
The track shows the most likely gene structure according to a
Semi-Markov Conditional Random Field model.
In case alternative transcripts are shown, these were obtained with
  a sampling algorithm (<tt>--alternatives-from-sampling=true --sample=100 --minexonintronprob=0.2
   --minmeanexonintronprob=0.5 --maxtracks=3 --temperature=2</tt>).

The predictions on fish species were done with the <tt>zebrafish</tt> version,
the predicions on bird species with the <tt>chicken</tt> version
 and the predictions on all other vertebrate species with the <tt>human</tt>
version of AUGUSTUS. In each case, the parameters of the model had been
estimated before on 1000-2000 training gene structures.
