<H2>Description</H2>
The $organism 
<A HREF="http://mgc.nci.nih.gov/">Mammalian Gene Collection</A>
full ORF mRNA track shows alignments between
$organism MGC mRNAs with full-length ORFs and the genome. 
Coding exons are displayed 
taller than 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTR). Connecting introns 
are one-pixel lines with hatch marks indicating direction of transcription.

<H2>Method</H2>
Genbank $organism MGC mRNAs identified as having full-length ORFs are
aligned against the genome using the  BLAT program. When a single mRNA aligns
in multiple places, the alignment having the highest base identity is found. 
Only alignments that have a base identity level within 1% of
the best are kept. Alignments must also have at least 95%
base identity to be kept.

<H2>Credits</H2>
The $Organism MGC full-length mRNA track is produced at UCSC from mRNA sequence data
submitted to 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html">Genbank</A>
by the 
<A HREF="http://mgc.nci.nih.gov/">Mammalian Gene Collection</A> project.
