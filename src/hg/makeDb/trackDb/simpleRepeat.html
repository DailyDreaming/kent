<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays simple tandem repeats (possibly imperfect) located
by <A HREF="http://c3.biomath.mssm.edu/trf.html" TARGET=_blank>Tandem Repeats
Finder</A>, which is specialized to this purpose. These repeats can
occur within coding regions of genes and may be quite
polymorphic. Repeat expansions are sometimes associated with specific
diseases.</P>
