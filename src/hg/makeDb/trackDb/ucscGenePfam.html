<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
Most proteins are composed of one or more conserved functional regions called domains.
This track shows the high quality, manually curated 
<a href="http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/" target="_blank">
Pfam-A </a>
domains found in transcripts located in the UCSC Genes track.  

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<P>
This track follows the display conventions for 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay">gene 
tracks</A>. 

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
The sequences from the knownGenePep table 
(see 
<a HREF="hgTrackUi?g=knownGene">
UCSC Gene detail page</a>)
are submitted to the set of Pfam-A HMMs 
which annotate regions within the predicted peptide that are recognizable 
as Pfam protein domains.
These regions are then mapped to the transcripts themselves using the pslMap utility.
