<H2> Description </H2>

Instead of clone-by-clone assemblies, the Rat genome assembly is
pieced together from Bactig assemblies, which are reassemblies of the
reads from sets of overlapping skimmed BAC clones, including mapped
WGS reads.  The assembly process reworks the contigs (splitting some)
and selects them under more stringent criteria than used for the BAC
submissions.

<P>
The bactig names are of the form "gaab_gnmm" -- the internal names of 
the two bracketing projects.
