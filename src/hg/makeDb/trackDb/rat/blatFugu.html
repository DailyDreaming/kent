<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The Takifugu V3.0 (Aug. 2002) whole genome shotgun assembly was provided by the
<A HREF="http://www.jgi.doe.gov/index.html" TARGET=_blank>US 
DOE Joint Genome Institute</A> (JGI). The assembly was constructed with the JGI
assembler, JAZZ, from paired end sequencing reads produced at JGI, Myriad 
Genetics, and Celera Genomics, resulting in a sequence coverage of 5.7X. All reads are
plasmid, cosmid, or BAC end-sequences, with the predominant coverage
derived from 2 Kb insert plasmids. This assembly contains 20,379
scaffolds totaling 319 million base pairs. The largest 679 scaffolds
total 160 million base pairs.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The alignments were done 
with 
<A HREF="http://genome-test.cse.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat" TARGET=_blank>blat</A> 
in translated protein mode requiring 2 nearby 4-mer matches
to trigger a detailed alignment.  The $organism
genome was masked with 
<A HREF="http://repeatmasker.genome.washington.edu/cgi-bin/RepeatMasker"
TARGET=_blank>RepeatMasker</A> and 
<A HREF="http://tandem.biomath.mssm.edu/trf/trf.html TARGET=_blank">Tandem Repeats
Finder</A> 
before running blat. </P>

<P>The 3.0 draft from the
<A HREF="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/fugu6/fugu6.info.html" TARGET=_blank>
JGI <em>Fugu rubripes</em> website</A> was used in the
UCSC Genome Browser Fugu blat alignments. These data have been provided freely by the JGI
for use in this publication only.</P>
