<H2>Description</H2>
<P>Fgenesh++ predictions are based on Softberry's gene finding software. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
Fgenesh++ uses both hidden Markov models (HMMs) and protein similarity to find genes in a completely 
automated manner. For more information, see the paper Solovyev VV (2001), 
&quot;Statistical approaches in Eukaryotic gene prediction&quot; in the <em>Handbook of 
Statistical Genetics</em> (ed. Balding D. et al.), John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., p. 83-127.
