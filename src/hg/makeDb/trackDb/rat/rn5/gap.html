<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly (Mar. 2012, RGSC Rnor_5.0 (GCA_000001895.3))
of the $organism genome.

</P><P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is known, it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap. 
</P>
<P>This assembly contains the following principal types of gaps:
<UL>
<LI><B>contig</B> - Gaps between the scaffolds of a draft clone.
(In this context, a contig is a set of overlapping sequence reads.)</LI>
<LI><B>scaffold</B> - gaps between scaffolds in an assembled chromosome
<LI><B>Other</B> - sequences of gaps not marked in the assembly AGP files</LI>
</UL></P>
