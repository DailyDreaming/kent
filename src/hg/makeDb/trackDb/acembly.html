<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows AceView gene models constructed from
mRNA, EST and genomic evidence by Danielle and Jean Thierry-Mieg
and Vahan Simonyan using the <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/index.html"
TARGET=_blank>Acembly</A> program.</P> 

<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>AceView attempts to find the best alignment of each mRNA/EST against the
genome, and clusters the alignments into the least possible number of
alternatively spliced transcripts. The reconstructed transcripts are then
clustered into genes by simple transitive contact.</P>
 

<P>To see the evidence that supports each transcript, use the
&quot;Outside Link&quot; on an individual transcripts's details page
to access the AceView details pages. Each AceView transcript model
belongs to an &quot;Alternate Name:&quot; (gene cluster) that is categorized into a &quot;Prediction Class:&quot;
of either main or putative.</P>

<P><b>Prediction Class:</b> <font color=red >main</font> 
<BR> Class of genes that includes the protein coding genes (defined
here by CDS &gt; 100 amino acids) and all genes with at least one
well-defined standard intron, i.e. an intron with a gt-ag or gc-ag
boundary, supported by at least one clone matching exactly, and with
no uncalled base, the 16 bp bordering the intron (identical to the
genome over the last and first 8 bp of the successive exons). Also
included are some genes for which the CDS is smaller than 100
aminoacid, provided they have a NCBI RefSeq sequence (NM_#) or an
OMIM, or they encode a protein with BlastP homology (&lt; 10e-3) to
a cDNA-supported nematode AceView protein.</P>

<P><b>Prediction Class:</b> <font color=blue >putative</font>
<BR>Class of genes that have no standard intron and do not
encode CDS of more than 100 aminoacids, yet they belong to a category
that may be useful not to disregard completely. They may be of two
types: either they are supported by more than 6 cDNA clones, or they
encode a putative protein with an interesting annotation, for example
a PFAM motif, a BlastP hit to another species than itself (&lt; 10e-3),
 a transmembrane domain or other rare and meaningful domains
identified by Psort2, or a highly probable localization in a cell
compartment (excluding cytoplasm and nucleus).</P>
