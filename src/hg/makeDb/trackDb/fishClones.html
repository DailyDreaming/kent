<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows the location of FISH mapped clones along the 
draft assembly sequence.  The locations of these clones were
contributed as a part of The BAC Resource Consortium

human genome"</A>, <I>Nature</I> 409:953-958, Feb. 2001.</P>

<P> More information about the BAC clones, including how they can be
obtained, can be found at the 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/cyto/hbrc.shtml" TARGET=_blank>Human BAC Resource</A>
and the <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/clone/index.html" TARGET=_blank>Clone Registry</A>
web sites hosted by <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" TARGET=_blank>NCBI</A>.
On the details page for a specific clone, you can view the clone's entry in the Clone Registry by clicking on the clone name
at the top of the page.</P>

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>The track filter can be used to change the color or include/exclude a dataset 
from  an individual lab within the track. This is helpful when many items are shown in the track
display, especially when only some are relevant to the current task. To use the
filter:
<OL>
<LI>In the pulldown menu, select the lab whose data you would like to highlight or exclude in the display. 
<LI>Choose the color or display characteristic that will be used to highlight or
include/exclude the filtered items. If "exclude" is chosen, the browser will not
display clones from the lab selected in the pulldown list. If "include" is selected, the browser
will display clones only from the selected lab.
<LI>When you have finished configuring the filter, click the Submit button.
