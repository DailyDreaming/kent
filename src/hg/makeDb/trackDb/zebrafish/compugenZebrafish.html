<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Probes sequences were obtained from the 
<A HREF="http://giscompute.gis.a-star.edu.sg/~govind/zebrafish/version2/"
TARGET=_blank>Genome Insitute of Singapore (GIS)</A>
The sequences were mapped to the genome with blat followed by pslCDnaFilter 
using the parameters <TT>-localNearBest=0.001</TT>,<TT> -minQSize=20</TT>,
<TT> -minNonRepSize=8</TT>,<TT> -ignoreNs</TT>,<TT> -bestOverlap</TT>,
<TT> -minId=0.95</TT> and <TT>-minCover=0.10</TT>.  </P>
