Excerpted from the <A HREF="http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/" TARGET=_BLANK>Vega</A>

"The 
<A HREF="http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/" TARGET=_BLANK>
Vertebrate Genome Annotation (VEGA)</A> 
 is designed to be a central repository for high quality, frequently updated  
manual annotation of different vertebrate finished genome sequence.
In collaboration with the genome sequencing centres Vega attempts to
present consistent high-quality curation of the published chromosome
sequences."</P>
<P>
"Finished genomic sequence is analysed on a clone by clone basis using
a combination of similarity searches against DNA and protein databases
as well as a series of <em>ab initio</em> gene predictions (GENSCAN, Fgenes)."</P>
<P>
"In addition, comparative analysis using vertebrate datasets such as
the Riken mouse cDNAs and Genoscope <em>Tetraodon nigroviridis</em> Ecores
(Evolutionary Conserved Regions) are used for novel gene discovery. The 
annotation is based on supporting evidence only"</P>
<P>
NOTE: VEGA annotations are shown only on chromosomes 1-25 in this assembly.

For zebrafish, the <AHREF "http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/Danio_rerio/index.html" 
_TARGET=blank>VEGA</A> annotations consist of BAC and PAC clones that were 
sequenced for the zebrafish clone mapping and sequencing project. It is based
on the tiling path information from the fpc database.

Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</A> 
for providing the GFF files and additional annotations for the Vega genes. 
Vega gene annotations are 
generated by manual annotation by the Zebrafish sequence analysis group and

group at the Sanger Institute and <A HREF="http://www.zfin.org/"
