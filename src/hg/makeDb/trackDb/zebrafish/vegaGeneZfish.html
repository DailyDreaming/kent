<H2>Description and Methods </H2>
<P>
Excerpted from the <A HREF="http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/" TARGET=_BLANK>Vega</A> 
main page:</P>
<P>
"The 
<A HREF="http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/" TARGET=_BLANK>
Vertebrate Genome Annotation (VEGA)</A> 
 is designed to be a central repository for high quality, frequently updated  
manual annotation of different vertebrate finished genome sequence.
Vega attempts to present consistent high-quality curation of the published 
chromosome sequences."</P>
<P>
"Finished genomic sequence is analysed on a clone by clone basis using
a combination of similarity searches against DNA and protein databases
as well as a series of <em>ab initio</em> gene predictions (GENSCAN, Fgenes).
The annotation is based on supporting evidence only."</P>
<P>
NOTE: <A HREF="http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/Danio_rerio/index.html" 
_TARGET=blank>VEGA</A> annotations are shown only on chromosomes 1-25 in this
assembly. For zebrafish, the VEGA annotations consist of 
<A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/clones.shtml" 
TARGET=_BLANK>BAC clones</A>
that were sequenced for the zebrafish clone mapping and sequencing
project. It is based on the tiling path information from the 
<A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/WebFPC/zebrafish/small.shtml"
 TARGET=_BLANK>fpc database</A>.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track follows the display conventions for
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay">gene prediction
tracks</A>
with the following color scheme to indicate the status of the gene 
annotation:
<UL>
<LI>Black -- KNOWN: genes that are identical to known zebrafish 
complementary DNA or protein sequences and has an entry in the species-specific model organism database, <A HREF="http://www.zfin.org/" TARGET=_blank>ZFIN</A>.
<LI>Dark blue -- NOVEL: genes that have have an open reading 
frame (ORF), are identical or homologous to zebrafish cDNAs zebrafish ESTs or 
proteins in all species.  Novel transcripts are genes that fit the criteria of 
novel genes with the exception that an unambiguous ORF cannot be assigned.
<LI>Medium blue -- PUTATIVE: Putative genes are sequences identical or
homologous to zebrafish ESTs from the same species but do not contain an ORF.
<LI>Light blue -- PREDICTED: genes based on ab initio prediction and for 
which at least one exon is supported by biological data (unspliced ESTs, 
protein sequence similarity with mouse or tetraodon genomes or 
expression data from Rosetta).
<LI>Gray -- UNCLASSIFIED
</UL></P>

<H2> Credits </H2>
<P>
Thanks to Kerstin Howe, Mario Caccamo and Ian Sealy at the
<A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/" TARGET=_BLANK>
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</A> 
for providing the GFF files and additional annotations for the Vega genes. 
Vega gene annotations are 
generated by manual annotation by the 
<A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/" TARGET=_BLANK>
Zebrafish sequence analysis group</A> and 
the <A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/HGP/havana/" TARGET=_blank>HAVANA</A>
