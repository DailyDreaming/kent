<H2>Description and Methods </H2>
<P>
The following information is excerpted from the 
<A HREF="http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/" TARGET=_BLANK>Vega</A> home page:</P>
<P>
&quot;The <A HREF="http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/" TARGET=_BLANK>
Vertebrate Genome Annotation</A>  (Vega)
is designed to be a central repository for high-quality, frequently updated  
manual annotation of different vertebrate finished genome sequence.
Vega attempts to present consistent high-quality curation of the published 
chromosome sequences.&quot;</P>
<P>
&quot;Finished genomic sequence is analysed on a clone-by-clone basis using
a combination of similarity searches against DNA and protein databases
as well as a series of <em>ab initio</em> gene predictions (GENSCAN, Fgenes).
The annotation is based on supporting evidence only.&quot;</P>
<P>
NOTE: <A HREF="http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/Danio_rerio/index.html" 
_TARGET=blank>Vega</A> annotations are shown only on chromosomes 1-25 in this
assembly. On the zebrafish, the Vega annotation consists of 
BAC and PAC clones that were sequenced for the zebrafish clone mapping and 
sequencing <A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/clones.shtml" 
TARGET=_BLANK>project</A>. This is based on the tiling path information from the
<A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/WebFPC/zebrafish/small.shtml"
TARGET=_BLANK>FPC database</A>.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track follows the display conventions for
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay">gene prediction
tracks</A> using the following color scheme to indicate the status of the gene 
annotation:
<UL>
<LI>KNOWN (Dark blue): genes that are identical to known zebrafish 
complementary DNA or protein sequences and have an entry in the 
species-specific model organism database, 
<A HREF="http://www.zfin.org/" TARGET=_blank>ZFIN</A>.
<LI>NOVEL (Dark blue): genes that have have an open reading 
frame (ORF) and are identical or homologous to zebrafish cDNAs, zebrafish ESTs,
or proteins in all species.  Novel transcripts are genes that fit the 
criteria of novel genes with the exception that an unambiguous ORF cannot be 
assigned.
<LI>PUTATIVE (Medium blue): genes whose sequences are identical or
homologous to zebrafish ESTs but do not contain an ORF.
<LI>PREDICTED (Light blue): genes based on <em>ab initio</em> prediction and 
for which at least one exon is supported by biological data (unspliced ESTs, 
protein sequence similarity with mouse or tetraodon genomes, or 
expression data from Rosetta).
<LI>UNCLASSIFIED (Gray).

<P>
Thanks to Kerstin Howe, Mario Caccamo and Ian Sealy at the
<A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/" TARGET=_BLANK>
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</A> 
for providing the GFF files and additional annotations for the Vega genes. 
Vega gene annotations are 
generated by manual annotation by the
