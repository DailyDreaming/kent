<P>
This track shows location of the contigs of the July 2007 
$organism Zv7 assembly from
<A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/Zv7_assembly_information.shtml" TARGET=_blank>The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</A>.
<P>
A fingerprinted contigs (FPC) map was produced by 
restriction enzyme digestion with HindIII. Clones were selected from this for 
high quality sequencing. To create the Zv7 assembly, 1.02 Gb of sequence from
7,823 sequenced clones (7,139 finished and 684 unfinished) produced the
scaffold to which WGS assembly contigs were added to fill in the gaps. The 
chrFinished scaffolds from the Zv3 assembly (danRer1) have been placed on 
chromosomes since the Zv4 assembly (danRer2). For more 
information about the assembly, see the assembly track description and the 
Danio rerio Sequencing Project page at Sanger.

The Zv7 assembly contains 5,036 fragments. The WGS assembly consists of 
131,933 contigs having an N50 length of 20,127 bp and 22,961 supercontigs with
an N50 length of 1,499,123 bp.(n = 277). Of these, a total of 5010 scaffolds 
are not mapped to chromosomes: 166 are in Zv7_scaffoldXXXX scaffolds (tied to
unplaced FPC contigs), and 166 are in Zv7_NAXX scaffolds (not tied to an FPC 
contig, chromosome unknown).

The Zv7 Zebrafish assembly was produced by The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute,
in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, 
the Netherlands Institute for Developmental Biology (Hubrecht Laboratory),
and Yi Zhou, Anthony DiBiase and Leonard Zon from the Boston Children's 
Hospital.
