<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the location of the consensus sequences and the target
sequences used for the selection of probes on the Affymetrix Zebrafish 
genome chip.  
</P> 

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track follows the display conventions for composite tracks. This track 
may be configured to vary the type of sequence aligned - either consensus 
or target sequences or both.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Consensus and target sequences were downloaded from the
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=zebrafish" 
TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix Product Support</A> web page.
The sequences were mapped to the genome with blat followed by pslCDnaFilter 
using the parameters <TT>-localNearBest=0.005</TT>,<TT> -minQSize=20</TT>,
<TT> -minNonRepSize=16</TT>,<TT> -ignoreNs</TT>,<TT> -bestOverlap</TT>,
<TT> -minId=0.95</TT> and <TT>-minCover=0.15</TT>.  </P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
Thanks to <A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com" TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix</A> for
