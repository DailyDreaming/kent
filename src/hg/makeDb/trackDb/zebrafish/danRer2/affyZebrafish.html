<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the location of the consensus sequences used for the selection 
of probes on the Affymetrix Zebrafish genome chip.</P> 

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Consensus sequences were downloaded from the
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=zebrafish" 
TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix Product Support</A> web page.
The sequences were mapped to the genome using blat followed by pslReps with the 
parameters
<em>-minAli=0.95</em> and <em>-nearTop=0.005</em>.
