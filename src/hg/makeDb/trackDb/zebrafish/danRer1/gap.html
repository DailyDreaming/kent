<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the $organism assembly.  These gaps - with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic gaps - will be closed during the
finishing process.
</P><P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is known, it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap. 
</P>
<P>There is only one type of gap in the Nov. 2003 Zebrafish Zv3 assembly:
<UL>
<LI><B>Contig</B> - gaps between the scaffolds (&quot;super-contigs&quot;)
constructed from the WGS contigs.  
</UL></P>
<P>
For the virtual chromosomes containing scaffolds that could not be 
confidently placed on a chromosome (e.g. chrUn, chrFinished and chrNA), there 
1000 bp gaps inserted between scaffolds.
