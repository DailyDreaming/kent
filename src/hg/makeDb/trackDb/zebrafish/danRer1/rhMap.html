<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows alignments between $organism RHmapper sequences and the genome. 8707 sequences were aligned and they consisted of 2835 clone ends from Dr. 
Robert Geisler at the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Developmental Biology, 
Germany and from the Hubrecht Laboratory in the Netherlands, 2015 NCBI ESTs, 
171 RH shotgun sequences from Dr.Robert Geisler at the MPI and the Zebrafish 
Genome Initiative at the Children's Hospital, Boston and 3686 WZ ESTs from the 
<A HREF="http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/fish_lab/frank/cgi-bin/fish/" 
TARGET=_blank>WashU-Zebrafish Genome Resources</A>.

<P>These sequences are single-read (typically
approximately 400 base) sequences which usually
represent fragments of transcribed genes.  Aligning 
regions (usually exons) are shown as black boxes 
connected by lines for gaps (usually spliced out introns). 
In full display mode, arrows on the introns
indicate the direction of transcription.  This direction is
taken by looking at the splice sites. 
</P>

<P>Strand information provided for the sequences (+/-) indicates the
direction of the match between the sequence and the matching
genomic sequence.  It bears no relationship to the direction
of transcription of the RNA with which it might be associated.

<P>To generate this track, $organism RHmap sequences were aligned against the 
genome using the 
<A HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656" TARGET=_blank>blat</A> 
program. Only alignments that have a base identity level within 0.1% of the 
best are kept. Alignments must also have at least 80% base identity to be kept (pslReps parameters used were <em>-nearTop=0.0001 -minAli=0.8 -noIntrons</em>
