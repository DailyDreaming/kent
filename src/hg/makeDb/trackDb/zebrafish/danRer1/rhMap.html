<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows alignments between $organism RH (Radiation Hybrid) map 
sequences and the genome. 8707 sequences were aligned and they consisted of 
2835 clone ends from Dr. Robert Geisler at the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for 
Developmental Biology, Germany and from the Hubrecht Laboratory in the 
Netherlands, 2015 NCBI ESTs, 171 RH shotgun sequences from Dr.Robert Geisler at the MPI and the Zebrafish Genome Initiative at the Children's Hospital, Boston 
and 3686 WZ ESTs from the WashU-Zebrafish Genome Resources.
</P>

<P>The majority of these sequences are single-read (typically
approximately 400 base) sequences which usually
represent fragments of transcribed genes.  Aligning 
regions (usually exons) are shown as black boxes 
connected by lines for gaps (usually spliced out introns). 
In full display mode, arrows on the introns
indicate the direction of transcription.  This direction is
taken by looking at the splice sites. 
</P>

<P>Strand information provided for the sequences (+/-) indicates the
direction of the match between the sequence and the matching
genomic sequence.  It bears no relationship to the direction
of transcription of the RNA with which it might be associated.

<P>To generate this track, $organism RH map sequences were aligned against the 
genome using the 
<A HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656" TARGET=_blank>blat</A> program. Only alignments with a base identity level within 0.1% of the 
best are kept. Alignments must also have at least 80% base identity to be kept 
(pslReps parameters used were <em>-nearTop=0.0001 -minAli=0.8 -noIntrons</em>
