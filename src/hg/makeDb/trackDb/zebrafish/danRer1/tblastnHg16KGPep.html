<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track contains tBLASTn alignments of the peptides
from the predicted and known genes indentified in the hg16 knownGene track as of 2004-07-21.

<H2>Methods</H2>
The predicted proteins from the human knownGene track were aligned with 
the human genome using the tblastn. Filtering of results was carried out using
a threshold E-value of 1e-100 and, for each known gene peptide query, the top 5 
hits to the $organism genome were kept.

<H2>Credits</H2> 
tBLASTn is part of the NCBI Blast tool set.
