<H2>Description</H2>
<P>Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) are a key part of many large
scale sequencing projects.   A BAC typically consists of 50 - 300 kb of
DNA.  For $organism, the BAC clones are in the range of 2 - 650 kb. During the 
early phase of a sequencing project, it is common
to sequence a single read (approximately 500 bases) off each end of
a large number of BACs.  Later on in the project, these BAC end reads
can be mapped to the genome sequence.  
</P>
<P>This track shows these mappings
in cases where only one end is mapped. These are BACs for which there was only
one end sequence or only one end sequence mapped to the genome with a
good alignment. 

<P>A valid pair of BAC end sequences must be
at least 2 kb but no more than 800 kb away from each other. 
The orientation of the first BAC end sequence must be &quot+&quot; and
the orientation of the second BAC end sequence must be &quot;-&quot;.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>BAC end sequences are placed on the assembled sequence using

Additional information about some of the clones, including how it
can be obtained, may be found at the

To view the registry entry for a specific clone, open the details page for the 
clone and click on its name at the top of the page. Not all the $organism BAC clones have been submitted to NCBI Clone Registry as of July 2004 so not all the links to the NCBI for these clones will be working at this time.

The $Organism BAC End Singles track is produced at UCSC from BAC End Pairs 
sequence data obtained from <A HREF="http://www.eb.tuebingen.mpg.de/dept3/geisler/home.html" TARGET=_blank>Robert Geisler</A>at the Max Planck Institute for 
Developmental Biology, Germany and the <A HREF="http://www.niob.knaw.nl" TARGET=_blank>Netherlands Institute for Developmental 
Biology (Hubrecht Laboratory)</A> and the track was produced in collaboration 
with the <A HREF="http://zon.tchlab.org"
