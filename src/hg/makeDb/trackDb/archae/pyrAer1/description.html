The <I>Pyrobaculum aerophilum str. IM2</I> genome is 2.22 Million bp long and contains approximately 2706
predicted genes. <I>P. aerophilum</I> is a hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon which was isolated from a boiling marine hole at Martoni Beach, Italy. It grows optimally at 100 C, either in the presence of low amounts of oxygen or anaerobically. It is remarkable for being able to utilize five different oxidants in respiration: oxygen, nitrate, arsenate, selenate, iron (III), and thiosulfate.  The genome was sequenced and annotated as the PhD project of Sorel Fitz-Gibbon, a student in Jeffrey Miller's lab.<BR><BR>
The sequence was released Dec 2001 by the UCLA/CalTech, and was described

<blockquote><B>Abstract:</B> We determined and annotated the complete 2.2-megabase genome sequence of Pyrobaculum aerophilum, a facultatively aerobic nitrate-reducing hyperthermophilic (T(opt) = 100 degrees C) crenarchaeon. Clues were found suggesting explanations of the organism's surprising intolerance to sulfur, which may aid in the development of methods for genetic studies of the organism. Many interesting features worthy of further genetic studies were revealed. Whole genome computational analysis confirmed experiments showing that P. aerophilum (and perhaps all crenarchaea) lack 5' untranslated regions in their mRNAs and thus appear not to use a ribosome-binding site (Shine-Dalgarno)-based mechanism for translation initiation at the 5' end of transcripts. Inspection of the lengths and distribution of mononucleo... [Click above reference link for full abstract]

<p>
A genome position can be specified by chromosomal coordinate range, COG
ID, or keywords from the GenBank or TIGR description of a gene. 
The available chromosome/plasmid names are:<BR><BR>

The Archaeal Genome Browsers at UCSC were developed by members of the
<a href="http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/">Lowe Lab</a> (Kevin Schneider,
Katherine Pollard, Andy Pohl, Todd Lowe) and Robert Baertsch, with significant support from
the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/staff.html">UCSC Human Genome
Browser group</a>.
The Archaeal Browsers are run by a slightly modified
version of the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Human Genome
Browser</a> system.  All queries, bug reports, content corrections, suggested improvements,
and new track data submissions should be sent to Todd Lowe (lowe
