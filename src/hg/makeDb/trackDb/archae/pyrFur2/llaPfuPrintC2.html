<P>
This track shows unpublished microarray data from heat shock experiments. This data is provided for demonstration purposes only and will be updated as analysis is completed. Relative expression (log2 ratio) is displayed on a red (induced) to green (suppressed) color scale. Along side these, average intensity is displayed on a blue color scale with three values: dark blue = high expression, medium blue = average expression, light blue = low expression.
