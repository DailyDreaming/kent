The <span style="font-style: italic;">	
Natronomonas pharaonis DSM 2160
</span>
genome has 1 chromosome and 2 plasmids. The sequences are  
2,749,696
bp long and contains approximately 
2,822
predicted proteins.&nbsp; 
<span style="font-style: italic;">
N. pharaonis
</span> grows at high salt and pH and has multiple systems for nitrogen 
assimilation. 
 
The sequences were completed in 
Sep 2005 by Max Planck Institute,
and was published in
