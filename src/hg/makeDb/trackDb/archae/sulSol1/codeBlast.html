<p><big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span></big></big></p><P>This track is BLASTP run for proteins in <span 
style="font-style: italic;">S. solfataricus</span> against various categories.  It was built using the 
<a\nhref="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"> NCBI Link</a> version of blastp along with the NCBI protein database of GIs from Archaea, 
Bacteria and Eukarya.  The protein information for each gene was also taken from NCBI. The cutoff was set with an e value of 10^-3.  The 
alignments are 60 pluses("+") long with the first one being the complete protein of S. solfataricus.</P>
