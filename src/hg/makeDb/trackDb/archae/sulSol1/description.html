<blockquote><B>Abstract:</B> The genome of the crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 contains 2,992,245 bp on a single chromosome and encodes 2,977 proteins and many RNAs. One-third of the encoded proteins have no detectable homologs in other sequenced genomes. Moreover, 40% appear to be archaeal-specific, and only 12% and 2.3% are shared exclusively with bacteria and eukarya, respectively. The genome shows a high level of plasticity with 200 diverse insertion sequence elements, many putative nonautonomous mobile elements, and evidence of integrase-mediated insertion events. There are also long clusters of regularly spaced tandem repeats. Different transfer systems are used for the uptake of inorganic and organic solutes, and a wealth of intracellular and extracellular proteases, sugar, and sulfur metabolizing enzym...

<h3>Sample position queries</h3>
<p>
A genome position can be specified by chromosomal coordinate range, COG
ID, or keywords from the GenBank or TIGR description of a gene. 
The available chromosome/plasmid names are:<BR><BR>

The Archaeal Genome Browsers at UCSC were developed by members of the
<a href="http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/">Lowe Lab</a> (Kevin Schneider,
Katherine Pollard, Andy Pohl, Todd Lowe) and Robert Baertsch, with significant support from
the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/staff.html">UCSC Human Genome
Browser group</a>.
The Archaeal Browsers are run by a slightly modified
version of the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Human Genome
Browser</a> system.  All queries, bug reports, content corrections, suggested improvements,
and new track data submissions should be sent to Todd Lowe (lowe
