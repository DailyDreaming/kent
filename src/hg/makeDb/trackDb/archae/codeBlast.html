<H2>Description</H2> 
<P>
This track displays results from running BLASTP for all proteins in the genome against the <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" TARGET=_blank>NCBI</A> non-redundant data base, including sequences from Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya. The NCBI version of BLASTP was used. The protein information for each gene was taken from NCBI. The cutoff for determining a hit was an e value of 10^-3. The alignments are 60 characters long ("+" symbols), scaled to the length of the protein.
