The <I>Picrophilus torridus DSM 9790</I> genome is 1.55 Million bp long and contains approximately 1581
predicted genes. <I>P. torridus</I> is a thermoacidophile that can grow at temperatures around 60C. A membrane that is very impermiable to protons allows this euryarchaeon to live at pH as low as 0, while maintaining a pH of 4.6 internally.<BR><BR>
The sequence was released June 2004 by the University of Goettingen, and was described
in <I>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</I> <B>101</B>:9091-6 (2004) Futterer O, Angelov A, Liesegang H, Gottschalk G, Schleper C, <I>et al.</I> &nbsp;"<a

<blockquote><B>Abstract:</B> The euryarchaea Picrophilus torridus and Picrophilus oshimae are able to grow around pH 0 at up to 65 degrees C, thus they represent the most thermoacidophilic organisms known. Several features that may contribute to the thermoacidophilic survival strategy of P. torridus were deduced from analysis of its 1.55-megabase genome. P. torridus has the smallest genome among nonparasitic aerobic microorganisms growing on organic substrates and simultaneously the highest coding density among thermoacidophiles. An exceptionally high ratio of secondary over ATP-consuming primary transport systems demonstrates that the high proton concentration in the surrounding medium is extensively used for transport processes. Certain genes that may be particularly supportive for the extreme lifestyle of P. torrid... [Click above reference link for full abstract]

<h3>Sample position queries</h3>
<p>
A genome position can be specified by chromosomal coordinate range, COG
ID, or keywords from the GenBank or TIGR description of a gene. 
The available chromosome/plasmid names are:<BR><BR>

Katherine Pollard, Andy Pohl, Todd Lowe) and Robert Baertsch, with significant support from
the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/staff.html">UCSC Human Genome
Browser group</a>.
The Archaeal Browsers are run by a slightly modified
version of the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Human Genome
Browser</a> system.  All queries, bug reports, content corrections, suggested improvements,
and new track data submissions should be sent to Todd Lowe (lowe
