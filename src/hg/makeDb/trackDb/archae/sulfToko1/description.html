The <I>Sulfolobus tokodaii str. 7</I> genome is 2.69 Million bp long and contains approximately 2874
predicted genes. <I>S. tokodaii</I> is a hyperthermophilic acidophile. It grows optimally at pH 2.5-3 at approximately 80C. <I>S. tokodaii</I> is an obligate aerobe and metabolizes sulfur.<BR><BR>

<blockquote><B>Abstract:</B> The complete genomic sequence of an aerobic thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon, Sulfolobus tokodaii strain7 which optimally grows at 80 degrees C, at low pH, and under aerobic conditions, has been determined by the whole genome shotgun method with slight modifications. The genomic size was 2,694,756 bp long and the G + C content was 32.8%. The following RNA-coding genes were identified: a single 16S-23S rRNA cluster, one 5S rRNA gene and 46 tRNA genes (including 24 intron-containing tRNA genes). The repetitive sequences identified were SR-type repetitive sequences, long dispersed-type repetitive sequences and Tn-like repetitive elements. The genome contained 2826 potential protein-coding regions (open reading frames, ORFs). By similarity search against public databases, 911 (32.2%) ORFs were r...

<h3>Sample position queries</h3>
<p>
A genome position can be specified by chromosomal coordinate range, COG
ID, or keywords from the GenBank or TIGR description of a gene. 
The available chromosome/plasmid names are:<BR><BR>
