The <I>Pyrococcus abyssi GE5</I> genome is 1.77 Million bp long and contains approximately 1995
predicted genes. <I>P. abyssi</I> is a hyperthermophilic archaeon isolated from samples taken close to a hot spring situated 3500 meters deep in the south-east Pacific. The optimal growth conditions are reported as 103C at 200 atmospheres pressure.<BR><BR>

<blockquote><B>Abstract:</B> The plasmid pGT5 (3,444 bp) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi GE5 has been completely sequenced. Two major open reading frames with a good coding probability are located on the same strand and cover 85% of the total sequence. The larger open reading frame encodes a putative polypeptide which exhibits sequence similarity with Rep proteins of plasmids using the rolling-circle mechanism for replication. Upstream of this open reading frame, we have detected an 11-bp motif identical to the double-stranded origin of several bacterial plasmids that replicate via the rolling-circle mechanism. A putative single-stranded origin exhibits similarities both to bacterial primosome-dependent single-stranded initiation sites and to bacterial primase (dnaG) start sites. A single-strande...

<h3>Sample position queries</h3>
<p>
A genome position can be specified by chromosomal coordinate range, COG
ID, or keywords from the GenBank or TIGR description of a gene. 
The available chromosome/plasmid names are:<BR><BR>

The Archaeal Browsers are run by a slightly modified
