The <I>Pyrococcus abyssi GE5</I> genome is 1.77 Million bp long and contains approximately 1995
predicted genes. <I>P. abyssi</I> is a hyperthermophilic archaeon isolated from samples taken close to a hot spring situated 3500 meters deep in the south-east Pacific. The optimal growth conditions are reported as 103C at 200 atmospheres pressure.<BR><BR>
The sequence was released June 2001 by Genoscope, and was described

<blockquote><B>Abstract:</B> The hyperthermophilic euryarchaeon Pyrococcus abyssi and the related species Pyrococcus furiosus and Pyrococcus horikoshii, whose genomes have been completely sequenced, are presently used as model organisms in different laboratories to study archaeal DNA replication and gene expression and to develop genetic tools for hyperthermophiles. We have performed an extensive re-annotation of the genome of P. abyssi to obtain an integrated view of its phylogeny, molecular biology and physiology. Many new functions are predicted for both informational and operational proteins. Moreover, several candidate genes have been identified that might encode missing links in key metabolic pathways, some of which have unique biochemical features. The great majority of Pyrococcus proteins are typical archaeal ... [Click above reference link for full abstract]

<h3>Sample position queries</h3>
<p>
A genome position can be specified by chromosomal coordinate range, COG
ID, or keywords from the GenBank or TIGR description of a gene. 
The available chromosome/plasmid names are:<BR><BR>

The Archaeal Genome Browsers at UCSC were developed by members of the
<a href="http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/">Lowe Lab</a> (Kevin Schneider,
Katherine Pollard, Andy Pohl, Todd Lowe) and Robert Baertsch, with significant support from
the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/staff.html">UCSC Human Genome
Browser group</a>.
The Archaeal Browsers are run by a slightly modified
version of the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Human Genome
Browser</a> system.  All queries, bug reports, content corrections, suggested improvements,
and new track data submissions should be sent to Todd Lowe (lowe
