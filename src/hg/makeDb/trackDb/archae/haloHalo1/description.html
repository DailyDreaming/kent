The <I>Halobacterium sp. NRC-1</I> genome is 2.57 Million bp long and contains approximately 2674
predicted genes. <I>Halobacterium</I> is a halophilic aerobic euryarchaeon found under conditions of extremely high salinity, at an optimum of 4.3M salt.  It is a mesophile which grows optimally at 42C.  A well-developed genetic system is available for this species. <BR><BR>
The sequence was released Oct 2000 by University of Massachusetts-Amherst, University of Washington, and was described

<blockquote><B>Abstract:</B> We report the complete sequence of an extreme halophile, Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, harboring a dynamic 2,571,010-bp genome containing 91 insertion sequences representing 12 families and organized into a large chromosome and 2 related minichromosomes. The Halobacterium NRC-1 genome codes for 2,630 predicted proteins, 36% of which are unrelated to any previously reported. Analysis of the genome sequence shows the presence of pathways for uptake and utilization of amino acids, active sodium-proton antiporter and potassium uptake systems, sophisticated photosensory and signal transduction pathways, and DNA replication, transcription, and translation systems resembling more complex eukaryotic organisms. Whole proteome comparisons show the definite archaeal nature of this halophile with additiona... [Click above reference link for full abstract]

<h3>Sample position queries</h3>
<p>
A genome position can be specified by chromosomal coordinate range, COG
ID, or keywords from the GenBank or TIGR description of a gene. 
The available chromosome/plasmid names are:<BR><BR>

The Archaeal Genome Browsers at UCSC were developed by members of the
<a href="http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/">Lowe Lab</a> (Kevin Schneider,
Katherine Pollard, Andy Pohl, Todd Lowe) and Robert Baertsch, with significant support from
the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/staff.html">UCSC Human Genome
Browser group</a>.
The Archaeal Browsers are run by a slightly modified
version of the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Human Genome
Browser</a> system.  All queries, bug reports, content corrections, suggested improvements,
and new track data submissions should be sent to Todd Lowe (lowe
