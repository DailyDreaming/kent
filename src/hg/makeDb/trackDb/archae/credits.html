The Archaeal Genome Browsers at UCSC were developed by members of the
<a href="http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/">Lowe Lab</a> (Kevin Schneider,
Katherine Pollard, Robert Baertsch, Andy Pohl, Todd Lowe) with
significant support from the <a
href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/staff.html">UCSC Human Genome Browser
group</a>.  The Archaeal Browsers are run by a slightly modified
version of the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Human Genome
Browser</a> system.  All queries, bug reports, content corrections,
suggested improvements, and new track data submissions should be sent
to Todd Lowe (lowe @soe.ucsc.edu).
