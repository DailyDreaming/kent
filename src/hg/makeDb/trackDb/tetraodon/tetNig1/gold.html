<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows the <I>Tetraodon nigroviridis</I> Genoscope/Whitehead V6 
assembly provided by
<A HREF="http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/externe/English/Projets/Projet_C/C.html" 
TARGET=_blank>Genoscope</A>, France. 
The assembly has a sequence coverage of about 7.9X and contains 25,773 
scaffolds (supercontigs) totaling 319 million base pairs.
</P>
<P>In dense mode, this track depicts the path through the draft (aka the golden path) used to create the assembled sequence.  Clone boundaries are 
distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown coloration. Where gaps
exist in the path, spaces are shown between the gold and brown blocks.  If the 
relative order and orientation of the supercontigs between the two blocks is 
known, a line is drawn to bridge the blocks.</P>
<P>
The Genome Browser depicts the Tetraodon genome as 21 chromosomes, 5 random 
chromosomes in which scaffolds and ultracontigs are not ordered/oriented, and 1 
chromosome of unmapped scaffolds and ultracontigs (chrUn_random).
<P>
All components within this track are of fragment type &quot;W&quot;
(WGS supercontig).
</P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) sequencing was carried out at the Center for 
Genomic Research and Genoscope to generate this assembly.  WGS libraries were 
prepared from Tetraodon genomic DNA supplied by Genoscope.  A plasmid library 
with an average insert size of 4kb was created from randomly fragmented and 
size-selected DNA. Both ends of the plasmid inserts were sequenced.  Additional sequence data from plasmid and BAC end reads were generated by Genoscope 
resulting in a total of 4.2 million reads. Assembly of the sequences was 
carried out at Genoscope using the Arachne assembler.  Contigs (49,609; 
N50 length = 16 kb) were assembled into supercontigs (25,773; 
N50 length = 731 kb) which were than assembled into ultracontigs (128; 
N50 length = 1,382 kb) of which 39 were mapped to chromosomes.  Ultracontigs 
were constructed using mapping data and synteny information.

The Tetraodon WGS project may be found in Genbank as accession number 
CAAE00000000 consisting of sequences CAAE01000001-CAAE01025773.

The Tetraodon V7 assembly was produced by a collaboration between the Genoscope, Evry, France and the Center for Genome Research at the Eli and Edythe L. Broad
Institute.
