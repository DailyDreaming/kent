<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows the <I>Tetraodon nigroviridis</I> V7 assembly provided by
<A HREF="http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/externe/English/Projets/Projet_C/C.html" 
TARGET=_blank>Genoscope</A>, Evry, France. 
The assembly has a sequence coverage of about 7.9X and contains 25,773 
scaffolds (supercontigs) and covers >90% of the genome which is estimated to
be 385 million base pairs.
</P>
<P>In dense mode, this track depicts the path through the draft (aka the golden path) used to create the assembled sequence.  Clone boundaries are 
distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown coloration. Where gaps
exist in the path, spaces are shown between the gold and brown blocks.  If the 
relative order and orientation of the supercontigs between the two blocks is 
known, a line is drawn to bridge the blocks.</P>
<P>
The Genome Browser depicts the Tetraodon genome as 21 chromosomes, 5 random 
chromosomes in which scaffolds and ultracontigs are not ordered/oriented, and 1 
chromosome of unmapped scaffolds and ultracontigs (chrUn_random).
<P>
All components within this track are of fragment type &quot;W&quot;
(WGS supercontig).
</P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) sequencing was carried out and the assembly of the 
sequences was carried out using the Arachene assembler. Contigs (45,609; 
N50 length = 16 kb) were assembled into supercontigs (25,773; 
N50 length = 731 kb) which were then assembled into ultracontigs (128; 
N50 length = 1,382 kb) of which 39 were mapped to chromosomes.  Ultracontigs 
were constructed using mapping data and synteny information.

<P>
The Tetraodon WGS project may be found in Genbank as accession number 
CAAE00000000 consisting of sequences CAAE01000001-CAAE01025773.

<P>
The Tetraodon V7 release of the genome sequence was produced by a collaboration between the Genoscope, Evry, France and the Center for Genome Research at the 
Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.
