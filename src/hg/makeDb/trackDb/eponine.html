Eponine</A> is a probabilistic method for detecting transcription start
sites (TSS) in mammalian genomic sequence, with good specificity and
excellent positional accuracy.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Eponine models consist of a set of DNA weight matrices recognizing
specific sequence motifs. Each of these is associated with a position
distribution relative to the transcription start site. The model
currently in use on this server is shown below.</P>

<P>
Eponine has been tested by comparing the output with annotated mRNAs
from human chromosome 22. From this work, we estimate that using the
default threshold (0.999) it detects &gt;50% of transcription start
sites, with around 70% specificity. However, it does not always
predict the direction of transcription correctly, an effect that
seems to be common among computational TSS finders. </P>
