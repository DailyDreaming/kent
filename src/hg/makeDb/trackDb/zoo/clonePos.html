<P>
In dense mode, this track shows the coverage level of 
the genome.  Finished regions are shown in black. Draft regions 
are shown in various shades of gray that correspond
to the coverage.  
</P><P>
In full mode, this track shows the position of each contig inside each draft 
or finished clone (&quot;fragment&quot;) in the assembly.  For some assemblies,
clones in the sequencing center tiling path are shown with
blue rather than gray backgrounds.
