<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track displays translated alignments of 728 million bases of <em>Tetraodon nigroviridis</em> 
whole genome shotgun reads vs. the draft $organism genome. Areas painted by
this track are quite likely to be coding regions.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The alignments were done 
with <A HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656" TARGET=_blank>blat</A> in translated protein mode requiring 2 nearby 4-mer matches
to trigger a detailed alignment.  The human
genome was masked with <A HREF="http://www.repeatmasker.org" TARGET=_blank>RepeatMasker</A> and <A HREF="http://tandem.biomath.mssm.edu/trf/trf.html" TARGET=_blank>Tandem Repeats Finder</A> before 
running blat. </P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>Many thanks to <A
HREF="http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/proxy/cgi-bin/exofish.cgi" TARGET=_blank>Genoscope</A> for 
providing the <em>Tetraodon</em> sequence.</P>
