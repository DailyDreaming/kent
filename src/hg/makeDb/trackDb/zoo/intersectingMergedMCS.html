<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows  Multi-Species Conserved Sequences (MCS) found by 
intersecting the MCSs generated using the binomial-based and parsimony 
p-value-based methods.  Regions less than 10 bp apart have been merged into 
one region.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Further information about the methods used to produce these data will
be available in the paper 
Margulies et al. "Multi-Species Sequencing of Targeted Genomic Regions: 
Comparative Studies of Genome Evolution and Function". Submitted to 
<em>Genome Res</em>.</P>
