<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track displays the level of conservation for each of the selected
species based on 
<A HREF="http://bio.cse.psu.edu/dist/blastz.pdf" TARGET=_blank>blastz</A> 
pair-wise alignments.</p>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<p>
Blastz pair-wise alignments were performed between the NISC-generated
sequence for each species and the UCSC compiled human reference
sequence.
All sequences were 
<A HREF="http://repeatmasker.org/" TARGET=_blank>
RepeatMasked</A>, with repetitive sequences denoted
by lower-case letters. The blastz program does not initiate alignments
within repetitive regions, but extends alignments into these regions.</p>
<p>
Gray horizontal bars denote a mapping/sequencing gap. Percent
identities of less than 50% are not shown because they fall below the 
minimum y-axis value.
