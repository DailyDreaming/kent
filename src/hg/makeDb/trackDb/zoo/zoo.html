<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track displays the level of conservation for each of 12 zoo
species based on blastz pair-wise alignments.</p>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<p>
Blastz pair-wise alignments were performed between the NISC-generated
sequence for each species and the UCSC compiled human reference
sequence.
All sequences were 
<A HREF="http://repeatmasker.genome.washington.edu/cgi-bin/RepeatMasker" TARGET=_blank>
RepeatMasked</A>, with repetitive sequences denoted
by lower-case letters. The blastz program will not initiate alignments
within repetitive regions, but will extend alignments into these regions.</p>
<p>
Gray horizontal bars denote a mapping/sequencing gap. A percent
identity
less than 50% is not shown because it falls below the minimum y-axis
value.

<P>Many thanks to <a href="mailto:elliott@nhgri.nih.gov">Elliott Margulies</a>
for running the blastz alignments, putting the data in the proper
format, and for helpful discussions.</P>
