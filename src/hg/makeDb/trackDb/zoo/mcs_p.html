<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track depicts Multi-Species Conserved Sequences (MCS) defined using a 
conservation score threshold from the parsimony p-value method that 
selects the top 5% most conserved sequence. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Additional information about the methods used to produce these data will be
available in the paper 
Margulies, E. et al. "Multi-Species Sequencing of Targeted Genomic Regions: 
Comparative Studies of Genome Evolution and Function". Submitted to 
<em>Genome Res</em>.</P>
