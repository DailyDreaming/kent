<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The GC sample track shows the percentage of bases that are G or C in small regions across the genome.
Windows with high GC content are plotted at higher vertical positions
than windows with low GC content.  High GC content is associated with gene-rich areas.</P>
<H2>Methods</h2>
<P>
For each 1,000 base disjoint window, the percentage of G or C bases was calculated and plotted 
as two points at the start and end of the window. By default, the windows 
are not connected with horizontal lines. To modify the display to always connect
adjacent samples, enter &quot;-1&quot; in the &quot;Maximum Interval to 
Interpolate Across&quot; text box.</P>
