<H2>Description</H2>
This track displays NISC-generated, curated gene annotation for each of 12
zoo species and human.  Coding exons are displayed taller than 5' and 3'
untranslated regions (UTR).  Connecting introns are one-pixel lines with
hatch marks indicating direction of transcription.

<H2>Methods</H2>
Exon locations of known genes were determined by aligning human and/or mouse
reference cDNA sequences with each species' assembled genomic sequence.  Any
splice-site consensus, exon structure, or protein-translation errors
encountered were manually inspected and corrected.
