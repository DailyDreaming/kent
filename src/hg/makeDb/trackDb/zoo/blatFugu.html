<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The second draft assembly of the <em>Fugu</em> genome consists of 12,403 contigs,
or scaffolds. The individual contigs sizes range from 2-650K bp.
The draft sequence of the fugu genome available covers 320 Mbases of DNA
sequence. We estimate that this covers approximately 90% of the non-repetitive 
fraction of the genome, which has a total size, including repeats, of 
approximately 365 Mbases.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The alignments were done 
with <A HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656" TARGET=_blank>blat</A> in translated protein mode requiring 2 nearby 4-mer matches
to trigger a detailed alignment.  The human
genome was masked with <A HREF="http://repeatmasker.genome.washington.edu/cgi-bin/RepeatMasker" TARGET=_blank>RepeatMasker</A> and <A HREF="http://tandem.biomath.mssm.edu/trf/trf.html" TARGET=_blank>Tandem Repeats Finder</A> before 
running blat. </P>
