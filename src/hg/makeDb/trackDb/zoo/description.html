<A HREF="http://www.nisc.nih.gov/open_page.html?/projects/zooseq/pubmap/PubZooSeq_Targets.cgi" 
TARGET=_blank>NISC Comparative Sequencing Program</A>, 
whose goal is to sequence the same targeted genomic regions in multiple
vertebrates. Currently, data from the first target - corresponding to a 
1.8 Mb region of human chromosome 7q31 - are available on 12 species.
Future builds will include data from additional targeted regions and species.
The Target 1 data have been released in conjunction with the paper
Thomas, J.W. et. al. (2003)

The sequence data represented here were compiled from existing GenBank 
records. In addition to long-range assembly and standard feature 
annotation, the results of several analyses are displayed, including 
pair-wise sequence alignments, intrinsic sequence properties, and
sequence comparisons that reveal regions highly conserved across 
multiple species. Flat files of the assembled sequence and annotations
can be obtained from 
<A HREF="http://www.nisc.nih.gov/data/" TARGET=_blank>http://www.nisc.nih.gov/data/</A> 
or from the <A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#zoo">Downloads</A> page on this website. </P>

<H3>Sample position queries</H3>

<P>
Position queries for this release of the NISC Comparative Sequencing
Program browser are limited to the Target 1 region, which corresponds
to a 1.8 Mb portion of human chromosome 7q31. Search requests for features
that align outside this region will return a list of non-aligned search
results that link to the NCBI Entrez database. To change the species
data displayed in the browser, use the Organism pulldown menu (at the top of
the annotation tracks page).
<P>
The following list provides examples of valid position queries for 
the NISC Target 1 region.
