<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track depicts DNAse I hypersensitive sites (DHS) mapped to the human 
genome sequence. Each track element represents the surrounding 500 bp 
from the position of the estimated DHS, as determined from Smith et al. (2000) 
"Multiple Potential Intragenic Regulatory Elements in the CFTR
Gene", <em>Genomics</em> 64(1):90-6.

<P>
Additional information about the methods used to produce this data will be
available in the paper 
Margulies, E. et al. "Multi-Species Sequencing of Targeted Genomic Regions: 
Comparative Studies of Genome Evolution and Function". Submitted to 
<em>Genome Res</em>.</P>
