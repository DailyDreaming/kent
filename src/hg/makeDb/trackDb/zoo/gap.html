<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.  These gaps - with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic gaps - are being closed during the
finishing process. </P>
<P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is known, it is a &quot;bridged&quot; gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap. 
<P>This assembly contains the following principal types of gaps:
<UL>
<LI>Fragment - gaps between the contigs of a draft clone. 
(In this context, a contig is a set of overlapping sequence reads.)
These are represented by 100 <em>N</em>s in the assembly, whether or not there 
is bridging information.
<LI>Clone - gaps between clones in the same map contig.  These are represented
by 50,000 <em>N</em>s in the assembly if the gap is bridged or 100,000 <em>N</em>s
if it is not.
<LI>Contig - gaps between map contigs. These are represented by 200,000 
<em>N</em>s in the assembly.
<LI>Heterochromatin - gaps from centromeres (3,000,000 <em>N</em>s) or other 
large blocks of heterochromatin (size varies).
</UL></P>
