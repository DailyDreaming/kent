<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track is powered by Bing! and Microsoft Research. UCSC collaborators at
Microsoft Research (Bob Davidson, David Heckerman) implemented a DNA sequence
detector and scanned thirty days of web crawler updates, which covers
roughly 40 billion webpages.</P>

<H2>Display Convention and Configuration</H2>
<P>The track indicates the location of sequences on web pages
mapped to the genome, labelled with the web page URL. If the web page includes
invisible meta data, then the first author and a year of publication 
is shown instead of the URL.  All
matches of one web page are grouped ("chained") together.<br>
Web page titles are shown when you move the mouse cursor over the features.
Thicker parts of the features (exons) represent matching sequences,
connected by thin lines to matches from the same web page within 30 kbp.</P>

<P>The subtrack "individual sequence matches" activates automatically when
the user clicks a sequence match and follows the link "Show sequence matches individually" 
from the details page.  Mouse-overs show flanking text around the sequence, and clicking
features links to BLAT alignments.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
All file types (PDFs and various Microsoft Office formats) were converted to
text. The results were processed to find groups of words that look like DNA/RNA
sequences. These were then mapped with BLAT to the human genome using the same
software as used in the <a href="hgTrackUi?g=pubs">Publication track</a>
