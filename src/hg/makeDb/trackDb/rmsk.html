<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track was created by using Arian Smit's <A
HREF="http://www.repeatmasker.org/"
TARGET=_blank>RepeatMasker</A> program, which screens DNA sequences 
for interspersed repeats and low complexity DNA sequences. The program
outputs a detailed annotation of the repeats that are present in the 
query sequence, as well as a modified version of the query sequence 
in which all the annotated repeats have been masked. RepeatMasker uses 
the <A HREF="http://www.girinst.org/Repbase_Update.html"
TARGET=_blank>RepBase</A> library of repeats from the 
<A HREF="http://www.girinst.org/" TARGET=_blank>Genetic 
Information Research Institute</A> (GIRI).  RepBase is described in 
Jurka, J. "Repbase Update: a database and an electronic journal of 
repetitive elements". <em>Trends Genet</em>. 9:418-420 (2000).
<P>
In full display mode, this track displays nine different classes of repeats:
<UL>
<LI>Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), which include ALUs
<LI>Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs)
<LI>Long terminal repeat elements (LTRs), which include retroposons
<LI>DNA repeat elements (DNA)
<LI>Simple repeats (micro-satellites)
<LI>Low complexity repeats
<LI>Satellite repeats
<LI>tRNA repeats
<LI>Other repeats
</UL

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
UCSC has used the most current versions of the RepeatMasker software 
and repeat libraries available to generate these data. Note that these 
versions may be newer than those that are publicly available on the Internet. 
<P>
Data are generated using the RepeatMasker <em>-s</em> flag. Additional flags
may be used for certain organisms.  Repeats are soft-masked. Alignments may 
extend through repeats, but are not permitted to initiate in them. 
See the 
<A HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQdownloads#download16">FAQ</A> for 
more information. 

<H2>Credits</H2>
We'd like to thank Arian Smit and GIRI
for providing the tools and repeat libraries used to generate this track.
