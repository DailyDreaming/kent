<H2>Description</H2>

<P> This track shows predictions from
the <a href="http://rulai.cshl.org/tools/FirstEF/" TARGET=_blank>FirstEF</a>
(<u>First</u> <u>E</u>xon <u>F</u>inder) program. <P>

<P>Three types of predictions are displayed:  exon, promoter and CpG window.  
If two consecutive predictions are separated by less than 1000 bp, 
FirstEF treats them as one cluster of alternative first exons that may 
belong to same gene. The cluster number is displayed in the parentheses 
of each item. For example, "exon(405-)" 
represents the exon prediction in cluster number 405 on the minus strand. 
The exon, promoter and CpG-window are interconnected by this cluster number. 
Alternative predictions within the same cluster are denoted by "#N", where 
"N" is the serial number of an alternative prediction in the cluster.</P>

<P>Each predicted exon is either CpG-related or Non-CpG-related based on
a CpG score determined by the frequency of CpG dinucleotides.
As exon is classified as CpG-related if the corresponding CpG score is greater 
than a threshhold value and Non-CpG-related otherwise. If an exon is CpG-related, 
its associated CpG-window is displayed. </P>

<H2>Method</H2>

<P>FirstEF is a 5' terminal exon and promoter
prediction program. It consists of different discriminant functions structured
as a decision tree. The probabilistic models are optimized to find potential
first donor sites and CpG-related and non-CpG-related promoter regions based on
discriminant analysis. For every potential first donor site (GT) and an upstream
promoter region, FirstEF decides whether or not the intermediate region can be
a potential first exon, based on a set of quadratic discriminant functions.
FirstEF calculates the <i>a posteriori</i> probabilities of exon, donor, and
promoter for a given GT and an upstream window of length 570 bp.</P>
