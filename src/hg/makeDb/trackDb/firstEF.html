<H2>Method</H2>

<P>FirstEF is a 5' terminal exon and promoter
prediction program. It consists of different discriminant functions structured
as a decision tree. The probabilistic models are optimized to find potential
first donor sites and CpG-related and non-CpG-related promoter regions based on
discriminant analysis. For every potential first donor site (GT) and an upstream
promoter region, FirstEF decides whether or not the intermediate region can be
a potential first exon, based on a set of quadratic discriminant functions.
FirstEF calculates the <i>a posteriori</i> probabilities of exon, donor, and
promoter for a given GT and an upstream window of length 570 bp.</P>
