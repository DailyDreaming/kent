<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track displays alignments of the mouse genome vs.
the human genome.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The alignments were done with 
<A HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656" TARGET=_blank>blat</A> 
in translated protein mode
using the parameters -q=dnax -t=dnax and otherwise the default
settings. Both genomes were masked with 
<A HREF="http://repeatmasker.genome.washington.edu/cgi-bin/RepeatMasker" TARGET=_blank>RepeatMasker</A> 
and <A HREF="http://tandem.biomath.mssm.edu/trf/trf.html" TARGET=_blank>Tandem Repeats Finder</A> before running blat.  Places where more than 250 alignments happened
over the same place were filtered out.  Beware of alignments of greater than 
97% identity: these may reflect mouse contamination in the human genome or
human contamination in the mouse genome.</P>

<P>This track is produced at UCSC. Mouse sequence data is provided by the 
Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium. </P>
