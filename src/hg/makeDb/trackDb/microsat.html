<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays regions that are likely to be useful as microsatellite
markers. These are sequences of at least 15 perfect di-nucleotide and 
tri-nucleotide repeats.  These tend to be highly polymorphic in the
population.

This track is a subset of the Simple Repeats track, selecting only
repeats of period 2 and 3, with 100% identity and no indels, and with
at least 15 copies of the repeat.  The Simple Repeats track is
created with Tandem Repeats Finder.  For more information about the Tandem 
Repeats Finder, see Benson, G. <A HREF="http://nar.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/2/573"
