  This track includes predicted amplicons that are in the process of 
RT-PCR.  These usually consist of probabilistically inferred genomic 
structures.  Primers are chosen so that they amplify at least one intron 
that is determined to be novel.  Usually an intron is determined novel 
is there is no dbEST, genbank human mRNA, Refseq gene, or HIT from a 
previous experiment that supports it.  Supported is defined as having a 
blast alignment HSP (parameters: 'W=15 V=100 B=10 M=1 N=-3 -Q=10 -R=10') 
with at least 98 matches on a 100bp alignment window when aligned the 
predicted cDNA to ESTs, mRNAs or sequences we get from previous 
experiments.  The aligned region of this HSP need to cover at least 10bp 
on both sides of the splice site.
