<H2>Description</H2>
This track contains the alignments of the JGI predicted transcripts to the
$Organism genome.
<P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
</P>
JGI's predicted peptides were aligned to their predicted transcripts using the BLAT program to
establish the coding portion of the transcript.  The transcripts were then
aligned to the $Organism genome using BLAT.

regions of the genome, see Dehal et al.,
