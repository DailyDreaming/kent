<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track contains alignments of predicted transcripts from the 
<A HREF="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/ciona/" TARGET=_BLANK>DOE Joint Genome 
Institute</A> (JGI) to the <em>$Organism</em> genome.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Predicted peptides from JGI were aligned to their predicted transcripts using the 
Blat program to establish the coding portion of the transcript. The transcripts 
were then aligned to the <em>$Organism</em> genome using Blat.
For more information about this assembly and an analysis of the euchromatic
regions of the genome, see Dehal et al.,
