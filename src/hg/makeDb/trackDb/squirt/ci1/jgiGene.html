<H2>Description</H2>
This track contains the alignments of predicted transcripts from the DOE
Joint Genome Institute (JGI) to the <em>$Organism</em> genome.
<P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
</P>
JGI's predicted peptides were aligned to their predicted transcripts using the 
Blat program to establish the coding portion of the transcript. The transcripts 
were then aligned to the <em>$Organism</em> genome using Blat.
