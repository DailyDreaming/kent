<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The <em>C. savignyi</em> genome was provided by the
Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard.
<P>
The strand information (+/-) for this track is in two parts.  The
first + or - indicates the orientation of the query sequence whose
translated protein produced the match.  The second + or - indicates the
orientation of the matching translated genomic sequence.  Because the two
orientations of a DNA sequence give different predicted protein sequences,
there are four combinations.  ++ is not the same as --; nor is +- the same
as -+.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The alignments were done 
with <A HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656" TARGET=_blank>blat</A> 
in translated protein mode requiring 2 nearby 4-mer matches
to trigger a detailed alignment.  The <em>$organism</em>
genome was masked with RepeatMasker and Tandem Repeat Finder before 
running blat. </P>

Thanks to the <A HREF="http://www.broad.mit.edu/" TARGET=_blank>Broad 
Institute</A> for providing the <em>C. savignyi</em> sequence.
