<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) is a polymorphic locus which contains alleles that differentially affect the expression of a continuously distributed phenotypic trait. Usually it is a marker described by statistical association to quantitative variation in the particular phenotypic trait that is thought to be controlled by the cumulative action of alleles at multiple loci.
