<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This dataset represents 31 independent samples of different regions of developing craniofacial structures obtained from embryonic day 10.5 and 11.5 mouse embryos. RNA was prepared separately from each sample and subjected to a custom mRNA microlabeling protocol so as to allow for hybridization to individual Affymetrix Mouse Genes ST 1.0 microarrays. The various samples correspond to independent replicates from e10.5 Rathke's Pouch cells, e10.5 Nasal Pit cells, e10.5 Medial Neuroepithelial region cells, e10.5 Medial Nasal Prominence cells, e10.5 Maxillary Arch cells, e10.5 Lateral Nasal Prominence cells, and e11.5 medial Nasal Prominence cells.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>Microarry data was subjected to RMA normalization and individual gene expression levels per probeset per sample were expressed as a ratio relative to the level of that probeset's expression using whole Postnatal day 1 mouse RNA as a universal reference.  Colored blocks extend over the length of the corresponding gene and depict expression in the craniofacial sample relative to that in the reference RNA sample.

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
Dissections, RNA purification, and labeling were carried out by Eric Brunskill and Steven Potter; hybridization and processing by Sean Smith and Hung-Chi Liang in the Cincinnati Children's Hospital gene expression analysis core, and data was analyzed and transformed into UCSC genome browser array format by Andrew Plassard and Bruce Aronow. <H2>References</H2><P>Manuscripts pending; project part of the Facebase Consortium (<a href="http://www.facebase.org/">http://www.facebase.org/</a>).
