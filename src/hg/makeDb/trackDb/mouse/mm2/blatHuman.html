<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track displays alignments of the human genome vs.
the mouse genome.</P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The alignments were done with BLAT in translated protein mode
using the parameters -q=dnax -t=dnax and otherwise the default
settings. Both genomes were masked with RepeatMasker and Tandem Repeat 
Finder before running BLAT.  Places where more than 250 alignments happened
over the same place were filtered out.  Beware of alignments of greater than 
97% identity: these may reflect mouse contamination in the human genome or
human contamination in the mouse genome.</P>
<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>This track is produced at UCSC. Mouse sequence data is provided by the 
Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium.
