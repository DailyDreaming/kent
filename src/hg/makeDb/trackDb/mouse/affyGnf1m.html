<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This track shows the location of the sequences used for the selection of probes on the 
Affymetrix GNF1M chips.  This contains 31,000 non-overlapping mouse genes and
gene predictions.</P>

<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>The sequences were mapped to the genome using blat followed by pslReps with 
the parameters -minCover=0.3 -minAli=0.95 and -nearTop=0.005.
