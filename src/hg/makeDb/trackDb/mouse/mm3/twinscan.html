Twinscan predicts genes in a manner similar to Genscan, except that
Twinscan takes advantage of genome comparison to improve gene prediction
accuracy. The Nov. 2002 (hg13) human assembly was used in creating this 
annotation.

The Twinscan algorithm is described in Korf, I., P. Flicek, D. Duan, and M.R. Brent.
