<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track displays translated alignments of 728 million bases of <I>Tetraodon nigroviridis</I> 
whole genome shotgun reads vs. the draft $organism genome. Areas painted by
this track are quite likely to be coding regions.</P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The alignments were done 
with 
<A HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656" TARGET=_blank>blat</A> 
in translated protein mode requiring two nearby 4-mer matches
to trigger a detailed alignment.  The human
genome was masked with 
<A HREF="http://www.repeatmasker.org" TARGET=_blank>
RepeatMasker</A> and Tandem Repeat Finder before 
running blat. </P>
<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>Many thanks to <A

providing the <em>Tetraodon</em> sequence.</P>
