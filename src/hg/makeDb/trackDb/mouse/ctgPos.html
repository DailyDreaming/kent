<H2>Description</H2>
This track shows the locations of $organism contigs on the physical map. 
The underlying data are derived from the NCBI <em>seq_contig.md</em> file 
that accompanies this assembly. Although the  NCBI file indicates the 
orientations of the contigs based on how they were assembled into the final 
sequence, all contigs in this track are oriented to the &quot;+&quot; strand.
