<H3>Sites by HMM</H3>
These subtracks contain the coordinates of intervals enriched 
for <B>H3K4Me3</B>, <B>H3K9Me3</B>, <B>H3K27Me3</B>, <B>H3K36Me3</B> or
<B>H4K20Me3</B> in mouse <B>ES</B> cells, as determined by a supervised
Hidden Markov Model. 

<H3>Sites by Windowing</H3>
These subtracks contain the coordinates of intervals significantly 
enriched for <B>H3K4Me3</B> or <B>H3K27Me3</B> in <B>ES</B> cells, 
neural progenitors (<B>NP</B>) and embryonic fibroblasts (<B>MEF</B>). 
Intervals were obtained by merging 1-kb windows with nominal p-values of < 10^-5. 
<P>
The coordinates indicate the beginning of the 
first window and the end of the last window. A fourth column was also
added, which indicates the maximal fragment density within each interval.
</P><P>
<B>H3K9Me3</B> enriched sites have been added. These
sites correspond to a somewhat more permissive threshold than the 
HMM-based sites analyzed in the manuscript. The maximum fragment
density can be used to rank the sites by confidence.
</P>

<H3>Signal Densities</H3>
These subtracks contains the ChIP-Seq fragment densities
analyzed in the paper. There are wiggle subtrack represents the 
density of <B>antibody</B> enriched fragments in <B>celltype</B>
at 25 bp resolution across the mouse genome.
<P>
A non-negative value indicates the number of uniquely aligned 
fragments oriented towards, and within 300 bp of, a particular 
position. Reads within 200 bp add 1 to the density, and reads 
within 300 bp add 0.25. (This is an approximation of the expected
number of fragments overlapping the postion, since the exact length
of each is unknown).
</P><P>
A value of -1 indicates a masked position.
</P>

<H3>Alignments</H3>
These subtracks contain the SMS sequence data and their alignment 
coordiantes on the mouse reference genome (UCSC version mm8).
