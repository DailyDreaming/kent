<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays aligned clones from the Stem Cell Database (SCDb) to the 
mouse genome.   SCDb is the work of the Lemischka and Moore labs (Princeton), 
and the Stoeckert lab (Penn).  Clones were derived from a subtracted cDNA 
library from a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and an HSC supportive stromal 
cell line, from both human and mouse cell lines.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
This track was assembled from BLAT alignments of SCDb as of July 15 
to the mouse genome (mm6/March. 2005). Default parameters were used for BLAT. For more 
information about the construction SCDb clone library, see the 
<A HREF="http://stemcell.princeton.edu/" TARGET=_blank>SCDb home page</A>.
