<P>
This track shows gene expression differences between adult male 
and female tissues, as described in Rinn, JL et al. (2004)

<P>
Five adult mouse tissues (liver, kidney, hypothalamus, ovary and testis) 
were studied. For each somatic tissue, triple selected poly-A mRNA was prepared 
from six independent pools (biological replicates), three male and three female.  
Likewise, three pools were prepared from the ovary and three pools from the 
testis. Each 
pool of RNA was derived from ten individuals. Furthermore, for each biological 
replicate, two cDNAs (technical replicates) were prepared and independently 
hybridized to Affymetrix MOE430A chips.</P>
<P>
In full display mode, medians of all replicates (technical and biological) for 
each sex's tissue are shown. To view the individual replicates, use the 
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/hgNear">Gene Sorter</A>. In packed and squished display modes, 
the average over all tissues is shown for each sex. Dense display mode shows the 
placement of the Affy MOE430A target sequences colored by overall expression 
level in both sexes, with darker colors representing higher levels
of expression.
