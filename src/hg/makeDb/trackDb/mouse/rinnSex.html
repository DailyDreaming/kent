<H2>Description</H2>

<P>This track is designed to show gene expression differences between adult male and 
female tissues as described (Rinn et al., 2004 Developmental Cell).  
Briefly five adult mouse tissues liver, kidney, hypothalamus, ovary and testis, 
were studied.  For each somatic tissue, triple selected poly-A mRNA was prepared from 
6 independent pools (biological replicates), 3 male and 3 female.  Likewise, 3 pools 
were prepared from the ovary and 3 pools from the testis.  Each pool of RNA was derived 
from 10 individuals. Furthermore, for each biological replicate two cDNAs (technical 
replicates) were prepared and independently hybridized to Affymetrix MOE430A chips.</P>

<P>In full mode medians of all replicates (technical and biological) for each sex's tissue
are shown.  To view the individual replicates use the <A HREF="../cgi-bin/hgGene">Gene
Sorter</A>.  In packed and squished modes the average over all tissues is shown for
each sex.  Dense mode shows the placement of the Affy MOE430A target sequences colored
by overall expression level in both sexes with darker colors representing higher levels
of expression.
