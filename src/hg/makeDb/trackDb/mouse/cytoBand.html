<H2>Description</H2>
<P>The chromosome band track represents the approximate 
location of bands seen on Giemsa-stained chromosomes
under conditions where 400 bands are visible across the entire
genome. </P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P> Data are derived from the Mouse400.dat file downloaded from the NCBI ftp 
site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/M_musculus/maps/mapview/.  Band lengths
are estimated based on ISCN-defined relative sizes.

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P> We would like to thank NCBI for providing this information.
