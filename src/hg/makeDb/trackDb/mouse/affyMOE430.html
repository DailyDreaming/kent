<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This track shows the location of the consensus sequences used for the selection of probes on the Affymetrix Mouse MOE430 set (A and B) of chips.</P>

<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>Consensus sequences were downloaded from the
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=moe430">Affymetrix Product Support</A>
and mapped to the genome using blat followed by pslReps with the parameters
-minCover=0.3, -minAli=0.95 and -nearTop=0.005.
