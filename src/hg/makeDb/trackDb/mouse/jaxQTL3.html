Approximate positions of quantitative
trait loci based on data released by

Mouse Genome Informatics Database (MGI)</A> on November 8th, 2004.

<H2> Method </H2>
Most of the QTL records contain an STS marker that exhibits the peak LOD score
for the marker-phenotype association.  This peak marker is represented by a 
thick (tall) bar.  
For records that have two flanking STS markers (with or without peak
LOD score data), the QTL region is represented by a thinner bar spanning the 
interval between the two markers.  
Where both flanking markers and peak LOD score are available, the thick bar is
superimposed upon the thinner bar.</P>
