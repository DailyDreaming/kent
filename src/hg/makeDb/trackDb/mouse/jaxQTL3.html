Approximate positions of quantitative
trait loci based on data released by

Mouse Genome Informatics Database (MGI)</A> on November 8th, 2004.

<H2> Method </H2>
For QTL records that has two flanking STS markers, the QTL 
region is represented by a thin line spanning from the first marker
to the 2nd marker.  Please note that most records of the current QTL data set
do not contain flanking markers information.

Most of the records do contain a STS marker that exhibited the peak LOD score for the
marker-phenotype association.  This peak marker is represented by a thick (tall) bar.
