<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track is produced as part of the ENCODE Project.
This track displays maps of histone modifications genome-wide in different
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=cellType">cell lines</A>,
using ChIP-seq high-throughput sequencing.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track is a multi-view composite track that contains multiple data types
(<EM>views</EM>). For each view, there are multiple subtracks that display
individually on the browser. Instructions for configuring multi-view tracks
are <A HREF="../../goldenPath/help/multiView.html" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.
<P>
For each cell type, this track contains the following views:
<DL>
<DT><I>Peaks</I>
<DD>Regions of signal enrichment based on processed data (usually normalized data from pooled replicates).
<DT><I>Signal</I>
<DD>Density graph (wiggle) of signal enrichment based on aligned read density.

<H2> Data Release Policy </H2>

<P>Data users may freely use ENCODE data, but may not, without prior
consent, submit publications that use an unpublished ENCODE dataset until
nine months following the release of the dataset.  This date is listed in
the <EM>Restricted Until</EM> column, above.  The full data release policy
for ENCODE is available
