<P>
This track contains genome-wide maps of Repressor Element 1-Silencing Transcription Factor (REST) binding sites in mouse stem cells, generated by the Stem Cell and Developmental Biology Group at the Genome Institute of Singapore. 

REST is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor that regulates a large cohort of neural genes throughout development. Aberrant REST activity is involved in cancer, epilepsy, Huntington's disease and cardiovascular disease.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Specifically, the ChIP-PET (chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to paired-end di-tagging) method was used, where 36bp PETs generated from ChIP DNA fragments enriched for REST binding regions were sequenced using the high-throughput 454 Sequencing technology. REST binding sites were defined as those having at least 5 overlapping PETs (PET5+). Mapping was carried out in two isogenic cell lines: the mouse embyronic stem cell E14, and the neural stem cell line NS5 (derived from E14). 

The REST binding sites are divided into two categories:
ES and NS shared sites: "ES_NS" (PET5+ in ES, PET2+ in NS)
ES-specific sites: "ES_only" (PET5+ in ES, PET<2 in NS)
Negligable numbers of NS-only sites were identified.
