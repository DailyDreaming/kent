<H2>Description</H2>
The 
<A HREF="http://supfam.org/SUPERFAMILY/index.html" TARGET=_blank>Superfamily</A> 
track shows proteins having homologs with known structures or functions.
<P>
Each entry on the track shows the coding region of a gene (based on Ensembl gene predictions).
In full display mode, the label for an entry consists of the names of 
all known protein domains coded by this gene.  This 
usually contains structural and/or function descriptions that provide valuable information to help users get a quick grasp of the biological significance of the gene.
<H2>Method</H2>
Data are downloaded from the Superfamily server.
Using the cross-reference between Superfamily entries and Ensembl gene prediction entries
and their alignment to the appropriate genome, the associated data are processed to generate 
a simple BED format track.
