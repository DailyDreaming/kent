Haplotype blocks derived from common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on Chromosome 21 by

<P>
The location of each haplotype block is represented by
a blue horizontal line with tall vertical blue bars at the first and
last SNPs of the block. Blocks are displayed as starting at the first
SNP and ending at the last SNP of the block. This is slightly
different from the representation on the Perlegen web site in which blocks are 
stretched until they abut each other. The shade of the blue indicates the minimum
number of SNPs required to discriminate between haplotype patterns
that account for at least 80% of genotyped chromosomes. Darker colors
indicate fewer SNPs are necessary.  Individual SNPs are denoted by
smaller black vertical bars. At multi-megabase resolution in dense
display mode, clusters of tall blue bars may indicate hotspots for
recombination.
