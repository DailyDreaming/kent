This is release 2 of the Mapability track for hg18. Five substracks were added 
to show alignability data from CRG created using the GEM mapper aligner. 
This set of tracks is from an ENCODE lab but only partially funded by ENCODE
and therefore no metadata is included on the track configuration page for 
this track. Documentation for building the track is in 
kent/src/hg/makeDb/doc/hg18.txt.
