# This is a hacky pipeline for a very small database. Snpedia has tens of thousands of pages, but most have been
# auto-generated. These scripts try their best to only show SNPs where something has been manually typed into the
# SNPedia page. They start from the Snpedia GFF file, use the SNPedia API (which we can hammer a bit, they're not picky 
# about that) get wikimedia markup, use that to reduce the number of pages, then download their html (because wikimedia 
# is very hard to translate to html), fix the positions for hg19 and hg38 and load up everything.

# remove all pages without any visible typed text
python $SRC/filterPages.py > build/goodPages.txt

# fix the positions using our own snp150 tracks
python $SRC/getPos.py > build/getPos.log

# get the html of the final list
