makeLoChain

This directory contains a suite of scripts
used for generating liftOver chain files and
associated database entries, for use with
the "liftOver" executable, and the "hgLiftOver" CGI.

Before running, the "to" assembly must be split
into 3K chunks onto a reasonable location
for cluster input (see make doc).

They are run in the following order:
        align   kk
        lift    fileserver
        chain
        net
        load

They are run on the KiloKluster, fileserver, or database server --
each script tests that it is being executed on the appropriate
host and gives warning.  Also, each script indicates which
script to run next, and where.
