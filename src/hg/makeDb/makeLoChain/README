makeLoChain

This directory contains a suite of scripts
used for generating liftOver chain files and
associated database entries, for use with
the "liftOver" executable, and the "hgLiftOver" CGI.

They are run in the following order:
        align
        lift
        chain
        net
        load

They are run on the KiloKluster, fileserver, or database server --
each script tests that it is being executed on the appropriate
host and gives warning.  Also, each script indicates which
script to run next, and where.
