        The tag storm format offers an easy way to describe a hierarchical set of metadata for
        your data. The format is presented along with a
        <a href="https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/tree/master/src/tagStorm"
        target="_blank">suite of utilities</a> that allow you to manipulate and interrogate
        your tag storm files.</p>
        <!--Example here-->
        <p>
        The format and utilities were developed by Jim Kent at the UCSC Genomics Institute.</p>
        <!--<p>
        A better explanation plus some tag storm examples would be useful here.-->

        <p>
        Sample Psychic can take your gene expression data and compare it to curated references.
        This comparison is used to produce a scorecard which shows how closely your data maps
        up to the curated cell types.</a>

        <p>
        The Brain of Cells is a collection of single brain data from multiple projects which
        has been carefully annotated and made through an Analysis Working Group (AWG). This
        data set is used as the reference for brain-related classifiers in Sample Psychic.
        A heart of cells AWG is underway in producing classifiers for heart cell types, and it
        is likely that a Pancreas of Cells AWG will be next.</a>

      <p><b>Regulator Inference by Graph-Guided LASSO Estimation</b></p>
      <p>
      RIGGLE (Regulatory Inference by Graph-Guided LASSO Estimation) is a machine
      learning framework designed to discover the transcription factor regulators of
      a cell development trajectory by taking in expression data, known transcription
      factor targets, and a cell development graph.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center">
      <img src="<!--#echo var="ROOT"-->/images/RIGGLE_demo.png" height="75%" width="75%"></p>
      <p>
      This process produces predictions for the transcription factor's
      activities in each of the cell types represented in the graph based on the
      coordinated expression of its targets, while respecting the developmental
      relationships between the cells.</p>

      <h4>MISCE</h4>
      <p><b>A Minimum Information About a Stem Cell Experiment</b></p>
      <p>
      MISCE, or Minimum Information about a Stem Cell Expriment, is a
      spreadsheet that attempts to collect a rich set of useful information (metadata) about
      any experiment involving stem cells. The hope is that in using MISCE, the detailed
      metadata will make the experimental data useful to others attempting to use it
      in the future.</p>

      <p>
      MISCE consists of a number of different modules with each module describing a
      different experimental process, e.g. celluar reprogramming or RNA sequencing,
      and all of the important information related to this process, e.g. &quot;Biosample
      disease stage&quot; or &quot;Assay platform&quot;. Each module can
      be included or excluded based on the type of experiment being performed. For
      example, you might not include the &quot;Assay_DNAMethyl&quot; module if you
      are not performing DNA methylation assays as part of your experiment.</p>
