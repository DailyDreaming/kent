<p>Welcome to the CIRM Genomics Hub, created from the Genomics Initiative from the
California Institute for Regenerative Medicine's
Center of Excellence for Stem Cell Genomics (CESCG).</p>

<p>The CESCG is made up of approximately 20 separate projects, all involving stem
or progenitor cells. The first release of information explores single cell expression
datasets in the human brain, tools to deconvolute complex mixtures of brain cells
into cell types and developmental states, and scorecards for in vitro differentiation
into brain subclasses.</p>
