<p>
CIRM's goal in establishing the
<a href="https://www.cirm.ca.gov/researchers/genomics-initiative/about"
target="_blank" class="standsout">CESCG<i class="fa fa-external-link"
aria-hidden="true"></i></a> is to apply genomics and bioinformatics approaches
to stem cell research to accelerate fundamental understanding of human biology
and disease mechanisms, enhance cell and tissue production and advance
personalized cellular therapeutics.</p>

<p>
The CESCG is composed of Operational Cores at
<a href="http://med.stanford.edu/cescg.html" target="_blank"
class="standsout">Stanford University<i class="fa fa-external-link"
aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and at
<a href="http://www.salk.edu/science/research-centers/center-of-excellence-in-stem-cell-genomics/"
target="_blank" class="standsout">the Salk Institute<i
class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and a Data Coordination and Management
Core at the University of California Santa Cruz, which currently support the following
research programs:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Center-initiated Projects: Two projects are applying advanced genomics approaches,
      one to explore cardiac disease and drug toxicity and the other to investigate cell
      fate and identity. A third project is developing innovative bioinformatics tools
      to establish molecular network models and to guide predictions of cell fate.</li>
  <li>Collaborative Research Program: Through the solicitation and participation in
      collaborative research projects, the CESCG provides stem cell scientists throughout
      the state of California with access to cutting-edge genomics and bioinformatics
      technologies, and expertise and assistance in experimental design and data analysis.</li>
