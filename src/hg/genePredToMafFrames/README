Notes:
    - use of static functions in many modules allowsfor for implict inlining.

    - both this code and the browser required no overlapping CDS exons

    - strand in mafFrames matches the direction of transcript as projected
      onto the target species:
              maf   maf
         gene query target annotation
         +    +     +      +
         -    +     +      -
         +    -     +      -
         -    -     +      +

    - the prevFramePos and nextFramePos are used for rendering codons that
      are split in the target.  These fields are in the direction of
      translation. MafFrame rows are linked by the prev or next fields 
      if and only if the first/last codon is discontinues in the target
      but contiguous in the query .
