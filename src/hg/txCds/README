This directory contains various programs to help map the coding
region inside of a transcript.  In the Known Genes III build
process it is applied to the bed file/fa file output of txWalk.

The overall pipeline is to convert various lines of evidence to
a common cdsEvidence format with:
   txCdsEvFromRna - handles refSeq and genbank mRNA alignments
   txCdsEvFromProtein - handles uniProt and refSeq protein alignments
   txCdsEvFromBorf - handles bestorf (via borfBig) predictions
These are then all concatenated together, and the best CDS for each
transcript is picked with
   txCdsPick
Then the transcript bed and sequence are turned into a GTF gene
prediction file and a protein sequence file with
   txCdsToGene
