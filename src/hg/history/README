This directory contains code to implement David's algorithm 
which given a set of elements (i.e. chromosome ranges) and
a set of distances between the elements resolves the
species tree as well as the location of the duplication
nodes.  The code also predicts the element orderings
at each node in the tree with will be exactly correct if
one assumes the "infinite sites" model.

This will replace our current method of determining
ancestral order which only attempts to guess the
ordering at the boreoeutherian node, not the rest
of the nodes (e.g. the glires ancestor (rat/mouse/rabbit)).
