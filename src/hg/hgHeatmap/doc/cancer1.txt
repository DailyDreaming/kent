ISPY Copy number variation data, subset of baseline T1 time point (Sept 24th, 2007, Jing)
I got two files from Koei at Joe Gray lab.  There are both CNV data.
- /data/ISPY/koeiCGH08152007/2007-05-16_MIP_ISPY_log2copysum_segment_means.txt (mapped to build 35)
-/data/ISPY/koeiCGH08152007/I-SPY.BAC.CGH.Baseline.N59.xls (mapped to build 34)

this is email from Koei:
Please note, MIP may not be the final version. It is just for you to
have some sense from MIP data set.

Mapping information:
BAC CGH - build 34
MIP CGH - build 35

-Koei

I noticed that some of koei's BAC data timepoint are noted with F1, others with F2. However, both F1 and F2 samples are from T1, i.e. baseline
