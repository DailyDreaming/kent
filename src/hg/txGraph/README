This dir contains code to make and modify transcription graphs (txGraphs).
These are graphs with a node for each start, end, or splice site, and
an edge for each exon or intron. They represent a fair approximation 
to a gene with possible multiple transcripts.

The pipeline for generating these is
    txPslToBed | txBedToTgx | tgxOrtho | tgxAddEvidence | tgxTrim | txgWalk
where tgxAddEvidence may be run several times to add different
evidence.  Here's a bit more info on each program:

txPslToBed - Transforms alignments to putative exons by projecting
    alignment onto genomic axis only.  It also merges together 
    blocks separated by only a small amount into exons.  It will
    extend or trim an exon by one base on either side to get
    gt/ag ends. It breaks up alignments with longer gaps that
    are not introns into separate bed records on either side of the
    gap.  Finally it trims small isolated bed records.
input: psl file, corresponding target dna
output: bed file
status: done

txBedToTgx - Clusters together overlapping exons (on same strand)
    and creates a transcript graph.  Associates evidence with each
    edge in the form of type, weight, name of item in bed file.
input: list of bed files, types, and weights.  Bed files are bed12
    (multiple block).
output: tgx file
status: in progress

tgxOrtho - Looks for orthologous edges in two graphs from two species.
input: tgx files from both species, chains & nets between species
output: bed file for introns, bed file for exons
status: planning.  Will reuse elements of orthoSplice code.

tgxAddEvidence - Adds evidence from a bed file to existing transcript
     graph.  
input: tgx file, bed file, type, and weight. 
output: tgx file with additional evidence.
status: planning. Will reuse elements of orthoSplice code.

tgxTrim - Trims a graph to the subset with sufficient evidence.
input: tgx file, weight threshold
output: trimmed tgx file
status: planning.  Will reuse elements of orthoSplice code.

tgxWalk - Walks graph producing transcripts. Does threaded walk
     following connected mRNA evidence (in current species) so
     as to avoid combinatorical explosions in alt-splice situations.
input: tgx file
output: bed 12 file (bed in exons)
status: planning. Will be hopefully minor changes to exonWalk.
