This contains stuff to analyse the UCSC gene set, but
not to build it.  It's mostly stuff hopefully for the paper.

Here's some of what is done

set gd = /cluster/data/hg18/bed/ucsc.10
set wd = ~/kent/src/hg/txPaper

cut -f 5 $gd/canonical.tab > $gd/canonical.lst
txPaperPfam $gd/ucscGenes.info $gd/ucscPfam.tab $gd/canonical.lst $wd/tables/pfam
