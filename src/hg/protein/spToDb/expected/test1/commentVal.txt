1	In microneme/rhoptry complexes.
2	Sporozoite antigen.
3	Stamen- and tapetum-specific.
4	Belongs to the A9 / FIL1 family.
5	This protein is required for germination.
6	Belongs to the plant defensin family.
7	This is a seed storage protein.
8	Hexamer; each subunit is composed of an acidic and a basic chain derived from a single precursor and linked by a disulfide bond.
9	Belongs to the 11S seed storage protein (globulins) family.
10	Major structural protein which may play a role as rickettsial virulence factor and/or immunogen during infection.
11	Cell wall. This bacterium is covered by a S- layer with hexagonal symmetry.
12	Its C-terminus potentially may bear the epitopes conferring antigenicity to the protein.
13	Belongs to the rickettsiae ompA/ompB family.
14	Belongs to the GTP1 / OBG family.
15	Catalyzes the oxidation of the 12-alpha-hydroxyl group of bile acids, both in their free and conjugated form. Also acts on bile alcohols.
16	3-alpha,7-alpha,12-alpha-trihydroxy-5-beta- cholanate + NADP(+) = 3-alpha,7-alpha-dihydroxy-12-oxo-5-beta- cholanate + NADPH.
17	Homotetramer.
18	The thermostability of the enzyme is greatly increased due to NADP binding.
19	Repressed by exogenous auxin.
20	 Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=1;   Comment=A number of isoforms are produced. According to EST   sequences; Name=1;   IsoId=P15455-1; Sequence=Displayed;
21	Seed storage protein.
22	Hexamer; each subunit is composed of an acidic and a basic chain derived from a single precursor and linked by a disulfide bond (By similarity).
23	Expressed only in immatures seeds.
24	Expressed between 7 and 28 days after pollination.
25	The sequence of the probable beta chain is highly homologous to the N-terminal sequence of BW24KD, a major buckwheat allergen.
26	Causes an allergic reaction in human.
27	Seed storage protein with a relatively high level of Lys and Met.
28	Cotyledons and endosperm protein bodies.
