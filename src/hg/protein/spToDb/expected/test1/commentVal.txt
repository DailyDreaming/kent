1	IN MICRONEME/RHOPTRY COMPLEXES.
2	SPOROZOITE ANTIGEN.
3	STAMEN- AND TAPETUM-SPECIFIC.
4	BELONGS TO THE A9 / FIL1 FAMILY.
5	THIS PROTEIN IS REQUIRED FOR GERMINATION.
6	Belongs to the plant defensin family.
7	THIS IS A SEED STORAGE PROTEIN.
8	Hexamer; each subunit is composed of an acidic and a basic chain derived from a single precursor and linked by a disulfide bond.
9	Belongs to the 11S seed storage protein (globulins) family.
10	MAJOR STRUCTURAL PROTEIN WHICH MAY PLAY A ROLE AS RICKETTSIAL VIRULENCE FACTOR AND/OR IMMUNOGEN DURING INFECTION.
11	Cell wall. This bacterium is covered by a S- layer with hexagonal symmetry.
12	ITS C-TERMINUS POTENTIALLY MAY BEAR THE EPITOPES CONFERRING ANTIGENICITY TO THE PROTEIN.
13	BELONGS TO THE RICKETTSIAE OMPA/OMPB FAMILY.
14	Belongs to the GTP1 / OBG family.
15	Catalyzes the oxidation of the 12-alpha-hydroxyl group of bile acids, both in their free and conjugated form. Also acts on bile alcohols.
16	3-alpha,7-alpha,12-alpha-trihydroxy-5-beta- cholanate + NADP(+) = 3-alpha,7-alpha-dihydroxy-12-oxo-5-beta- cholanate + NADPH.
17	Homotetramer.
18	The thermostability of the enzyme is greatly increased due to NADP binding.
19	Repressed by exogenous auxin.
20	Seed storage protein.
21	Hexamer; each subunit is composed of an acidic and a basic chain derived from a single precursor and linked by a disulfide bond (By similarity).
22	Expressed only in immatures seeds.
23	Expressed between 7 and 28 days after pollination.
24	The sequence of the probable beta chain is highly homologous to the N-terminal sequence of BW24KD, a major buckwheat allergen.
25	Causes an allergic reaction in human.
26	Seed storage protein with a relatively high level of Lys and Met.
27	Cotyledons and endosperm protein bodies.
