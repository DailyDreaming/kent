This file describes tdbQuery, in particular the RQL language, in more detail than the
usage statement you get from running tdbQuery with no parameters.

The trackDb system stores the track settings for the UCSC Genome Browser.  It consists of .ra
files in three levels of directories - root, organism, and assembly.  The assembly level corresponds
to a particular "genome database" like hg19, currently the latest human.  Records at the lower
levels override and extend records at higher levels.  In addition to the inheritance 
implied by the directory hierarchy, there is also inheritance defined by the "subTrack" field
in a record, which if it exists specifies the parent track.   A third type of inheritance
also exists, the "view" level.   The trackDb system is explained in more detail in the
README file in the trackDb root directory.
