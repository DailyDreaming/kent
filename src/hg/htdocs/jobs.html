Elucidating the function of 
approximately 500 ultra-conserved DNA sequence elements that show 100% identity 
between human, mouse, and rat genomic sequences for at least 200 contiguous base 
pairs
<LI>
Testing the function of new genes identified by computational searches for 
elements conserved in most mammals including chimpanzee, but which show 
significant changes in human.

Initially, the research focuses on two areas: 
<OL>
<LI>
Elucidating the function of approximately 500 "ultra-conserved" DNA sequence 
elements that show 100% identity between human, mouse, and rat genomic sequences 
for at least 200 contiguous base pairs
<LI>Testing the function of new genes identified by computational searches for 
elements conserved in most mammals including chimpanzee, but which show

<B>Summary of Responsibilities:</B> Under the general supervision of the Research 
Biologist, assist in the development and implementation of investigative 
procedures to accomplish research goals and independently perform scientific 
investigative procedures, actively contributing to the research results of the 
laboratory. Complex scientific procedures include DNA manipulation, PCR, RNA 
work, recombinant protein expression, purification, immunobiology, microscopy, 
and tissue culture. Supervise and perform technical and administrative tasks in 
the research biology laboratory, which is expected to grow to a team of 4-6. 
Oversee equipment maintenance, ensure adequate supplies for experimental needs, 
assist the research biologist in personnel management, manage lab safety programs
