<P>
The UCSC Center for Genomic Sciences, part of UCSC's Center for Biomolecular 
Science and Engineering, operates one of the most important scientific websites 
in the 21st century, <A HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu">genome.ucsc.edu</A>. More than 
5000 scientists worldwide use the site every day to access the fruits of the 
human genome project.  The site combines cutting edge research in genomics with 
solid software engineering and maintains a simple but flexible user interface. 
Keeping the site up to date is no small job, and one of the most important 
aspects of this job is quality assurance and user support.  We currently seek 
two entry-level biologists to serve as Software Quality Assurance & User Support 
Technicians (Programmer/Analyst I).
