<CENTER><B>Biological Database Testing and User Support Technician</B><BR>
Posted 7/28/04<BR>
(formerly posted as  "Software Quality Assurance and User Support Technician")</CENTER>
<P>
The UCSC Center for Genomic Sciences, part of UCSC's Center for Biomolecular 
Science and Engineering, operates a key scientific website, 
<A HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu">genome.ucsc.edu</A>. More than 
5000 scientists worldwide use the site every day to access the fruits of the 
human genome project.  The site combines cutting edge research in genomics with 
solid software engineering and maintains a simple but flexible user interface. 
Keeping the site up to date is no small job, and one of the most important 
aspects of this job is quality assurance and user support.  We currently seek 
an entry-level biologist to serve as Biological Database Testing and User Support 
Technicians (Programmer/Analyst I).
<P>
Summary of Duties:
<UL>
<LI>Study and learn the current web site: understand how biologists are using 
the genome browser now; recommend new features to help biologists 
<LI>Test new versions of the software: run the software thoroughly with an eye 
to the needs of the biologists who will be using the site; apply an understanding 
of basic genomics to detect anomalies and catch annotation errors; follow up to 
ensure errors are resolved
<LI>Examine new genomics data for quality: read the text describing the data set, 
then select one sample element and systematically use all display options 
available for that element; report problems encountered and ensure that they are 
resolved
<LI>Support users: assist in monitoring email communications received from 
scientists off-site to answer questions and troubleshoot problems; research 
answers to user questions regarding underlying biological assumptions and 
computational methods in the genome software and databases; follow through to 
ensure that user questions are answered satisfactorily. 
<LI>Report problems: communicate effectively about technical problems with UCSC 
team members and with external scientists and researchers; using the existing 
reporting system, develop accurate, complete, terse descriptions of problems; 
develop an awareness of existing problems; assess the importance of problems; 
ensure that high priority problems are resolved 
</UL>
<P>
Qualifications (with or without accommodation):  
<UL>
<LI>BA or BS in a biological science or an equivalent combination of education 
and experience
<LI>Broad knowledge in biology and deep knowledge of gene sequence organization, 
genome maintenance, and gene expression and regulation in eukaryotes
<LI>Solid web surfing skills
<LI>Strong writing skills
<LI>Strong verbal communication skills
<LI>Abilities to: tackle a large problem in a systematic manner; isolate 
problems by controlling conditions; communicate effectively and diplomatically
