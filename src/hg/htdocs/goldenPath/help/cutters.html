<P>
This track shows restriction enzyme recognition sites.  At different zoom levels (number of bases shown in the browser), there are different sets of enzymes shown.  The exception is when a custom set of enzymes is chosen to be displayed.  In that case, the same restriction sites are shown at all zoom levels.
