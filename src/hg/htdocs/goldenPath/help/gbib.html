<div class="section">
<h1>What is Genome Browser in a Box?</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<P>
Genome Browser in a Box (GBiB) is a &quot;virtual machine&quot; of the entire UCSC Genome Browser 
website
that is designed to run on most PCs (Windows, Mac OSX or Linux). GBiB allows you to access much
of the UCSC Genome Browser's functionality from the comfort of your own computer. It is particularly
directed at individuals who want to use the Genome Browser's functionality to view protected data. 
With the anticipation that the majority of protected data use will focus on the human genomes 
(primarily GRCh37/hg19, and transitioning to GRCh38/hg38), the current version of GBiB 
has been optimized for use with the hg19 assembly. Many other recent genome assemblies can
also be viewed, but without <A HREF="#GbibMirroring">mirroring</A> of additional data, they may be 
slow.
</P>

<P><B>Differences between GBiB and the Genome Browser</B></P>
<P>
While GBiB and the Genome Browser are similar in many ways, there are several key differences.
In particular, GBiB makes it much easier to visualize sensitive or protected data. 
Prior to GBiB, viewing your own data using the Genome Browser required either uploading your data
to the UCSC Genome Browser website or placing your file on a publicly accessible web server and
supplying the URL to UCSC. With GBiB, however, none of your data is uploaded to UCSC, which means
that you can use GBiB to view your data even in situations where it's infeasible to load your data
onto a public web server.
</P>

<P>
The GBiB installation does not include the entire UCSC genome annotation database (several terabytes
of data). Instead, GBiB depends upon remote connections to various UCSC servers for much of its 
functionality and data. It connects to the UCSC 
<A HREF="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html" TARGET="_BLANK">download server</A>
to obtain genomic sequences, liftOver files, and many of the other large data files, and
connects to UCSC's <A HREF="mysql.html">public MySQL server</A> to download data displayed by the
various tracks. Unfortunately, a few Genome Browser tracks are unavailable on our public MySQL
server due to agreements with the data distributors (DECIPHER and LOVD Variants), and thus are 
unavailable for use with GBiB.
</P>

<P>
Depending on your connection distance from UCSC, remote access to the
UCSC databases may be slow. For this situation, the GBiB includes a simple tool that allows 
downloading (&quot;mirroring&quot;) of selected genome annotation tracks to your machine. You can 
find more information about this tool in the 
<A HREF="#GbibMirroring">Improving Speed and Performance</A> section.
</P>
</div><!-- .sectionContent -->
</div><!-- .section -->

<A NAME="GetStarted"></A>
<div class="section">
<h1>Getting Started: Setting up Genome Browser in a Box</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<P>
GBiB will run on most modern PCs and major operating systems that meet these basic requirements: 
<ul>
    <li>The computer must support virtualization (common for most PCs sold after 2010).</li>

    <li>A compatible version of the <A HREF="https://www.virtualbox.org/" 
    TARGET="_BLANK">VirtualBox</A> software (versions 4.3.6 through 4.3.12)
    must be installed. This software is free to use in many situations. See the VirtualBox wiki
    for <A HREF="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Licensing_FAQ" 
    TARGET="_BLANK">licensing terms and conditions</A> and 
    <A HREF="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" TARGET="_blank">installation</A> 
    instructions. Note that you must have administrator rights for your computer to install 
    VirtualBox.</li>

    <li>The computer hard disk must have at least 20 GB of free space (more if you plan to mirror 
    many tracks).</li>

    <li>Your network firewall must allow connections on the following ports:
	<ul>
	    <li>Port 3306, used by MySQL. Without this, only mirrored tracks are shown.</li>
	    <li>TCP port 873, used by rsync. Without this, you cannot download track data.</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
</ul></P>

<P><B>Installation</B></P>
<P>
Once you have confirmed that your PC meets the above requirements, download the GBiB .zip file from 
the <a href="//genome-store.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">Genome Browser store</a>.
Because this file is several gigabytes in size, the download time may range from
30 minutes to a few hours depending on your Internet speed and connection distance 
from UCSC. When the download has completed, extract the contents of the gbib.zip file
(three files).  The extracted files can be moved to a different directory,
as long as all three files reside in the same directory and are not renamed.
<B>Extraction notes:</B> On OSX, do not use the command line tool &quot;unzip&quot; to extract 
the files; instead double-click on the .zip file in the Finder window. On Windows, you must 
use a third-party tool such as <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7zip</a> or
<a href="http://www.rarlab.com/" target="_blank">WinRAR</a> to
extract GBiB, as the file size exceeds the capabilities of the Windows extraction tool.
</P>

<P>
Add GBiB to VirtualBox in one of two ways: 
<ul>
<li>Double-click the file <em>browserbox.vbox</em> <B>OR</B></li>
<li>Start VirtualBox, select <em>Machine &gt;&gt; Add</em> (&#8984;+A on Mac or Ctrl-A on 
Linux/Windows), and open the file <em>browserbox.vbox</em>.</li>
</ul>
</P>

<P><img src="../../images/gbib-add.png"></P>

<P>
Finally, if needed, select &quot;browserbox&quot; on the left side menu of VirtualBox and click the
&quot;Start&quot; button in the VirtualBox tool bar.
</P>

<P><img src="../../images/gbib-start.png"></P>

<P>
If VirtualBox or the Genome Browser displays an error message during the installation
process, consult the <a href="#Trouble">Troubleshooting</a> section.

<div class="section">
<h1>Using Genome Browser in a Box</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<P>
After you have set up and started GBiB according to the instructions
in the "<A HREF="#GetStarted">Getting Started</A>" section, 
point your Internet browser to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:1234" 
TARGET="_BLANK">127.0.0.1:1234</a> (we suggest you bookmark this address). If you have correctly 
set up GBiB, you should see the UCSC home page. Once on the UCSC home page, you can start 
using GBiB as you would the public Genome Browser website. You can find an introduction to using 
the UCSC Genome Browser on our <A HREF="hgTracksHelp.html">main help page</A>.
</P>

<P>
<b>Note:</b> we recommend using 127.0.0.1:1234 as the URL to your GBiB instead of 
http://localhost:1234,
because most Internet browsers do not send cookies to &quot;http://localhost&quot; Without cookies, 
your browser configuration may not be saved between sessions.

<A NAME="GbibMirroring"></A>
<div class="section">
<h1>Improving Speed and Performance</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<P>
Under certain circumstances the speed and response time of GBiB may be less than optimal.
This section offers suggestions for improving the performance of your GBiB installation.</p>

<p><b>Increasing GBiB RAM</b></p>
<p>
As a first measure for performance improvment, try increasing the amount of RAM that GBiB 
is allowed to use. By default, this is limited to 1 GB. If your machine
has enough RAM installed, you might want to increase the RAM used by GBiB to 2 GB, 4 GB or even 8 
GB. To
increase the RAM, stop the box, click <em>Settings &gt;&gt; System</em> and move the memory slider 
to the value of your choice. This will usually improve the system responsiveness.
</P>

<p><b>Using the GBiB mirror tool</b></p>
<P>
If your GBiB performance is still slow, you may be located too far from UCSC.
The load time of default tracks ranges from a few seconds on the west coast of the United States
to as much as 7 seconds from Europe. In this situation, you may want to use the GBiB mirror tool 
to download (&quot;mirror&quot;) tracks to your machine, which will greatly increase the access 
speed for those tracks. To use the mirror tool: 
<ul>
<li>Click <em>Tools &gt;&gt; Mirror Tracks</em> in the Genome Browser menu. The first time you open 
the mirror tool, the page may take a while to load. </li>
<li>
Select the tracks
that you typically use by checking the boxes next to the track names, and then click
<em>Download</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition to downloading entire track sets, you can also download individual
subtracks. The file size of each track is listed next to the track name. If you are unsure of which 
tracks to select, we recommend the option <em>Default tracks with conservation tables, but no 
alignments</em>. When downloading large tracks, keep in mind that you cannot delete these tracks 
and the related data from GBiB once you have
downloaded them. If you find that you've started downloading the wrong track or a track that is too
large for your machine, you can cancel the download at any point by clicking <em>Cancel Download 
Now</em>. </p>

<p>
Depending on your network bandwidth, the download can 
take several minutes or up to a few hours over an DSL line. During the download, the file 
<em>gbib-data.vdi</em> will grow in size.
You cannot use the GBiB during this time. Once the download is complete, the
default tracks should load in less than three seconds for a typical genomic position.
</P>

<p><b>Offline mode</b></p>
<P>GBiB has an offline mode that is particularly useful when you want to
ensure that GBiB no longer connects to the Internet following the initial download and set up 
(for instance, to comply with corporate IT
policy). Before going offline, first mirror all the tracks that you need, then click on 
the black terminal screen and type the command: <tt>gbibOffline</tt>.
This command will remove GBiB's network access to the UCSC MySQL server and download servers.</p>
<p>
Once GBiB is in offline mode, the Genome Browser will display an error message if you attempt to
access a data file not located on your local disk; therefore, we do not recommend this option for 
general use. To reactivate Internet access, click on the black terminal screen 
and type the command: <tt>gbibOnline</tt>.
</P>

<A NAME="UpdatingGbib"></A>
<div class="section">
<h1>Updating Genome Browser in a Box</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<P>
The software that supports the UCSC Genome Browser is updated every three weeks. These updates
include new features and bug fixes for existing features. The track data, on the other hand,
is not updated on a regular basis. New tracks and updates to existing tracks are released as
they pass UCSC's quality assurance process. The only exceptions to this are GenBank tracks, 
including RefSeq Genes, GenBank mRNAs, and others, which are updated weekly through an
automatic process.
</P>

<p><b>Automatic updates</b></p>
<P>
By default, GBiB is set up to automatically update.
During this process, it will update all of the files in GBiB, including software and tracks
that you have mirrored. The updates will not affect your custom tracks, user accounts or sessions.
This auto-update process ensures that you always have the newest data and features.
We recommend that you leave the auto-update process turned on if Internet connection speed is not 
an issue, to ensure that you receive all the latest software features and bug fixes, as well as 
updates to your mirrored tracks. </p>

<p>
If you are using a DSL line, we recommend turning off automatic updates. Over a slow internet 
connection, the GBiB update may take several hours to complete, during which time the software is unusable.
</P>

<P>
To turn off the auto-update process, start GBiB and then click on the black terminal screen 
and type the command: <tt>gbibAutoUpdateOff</tt>.
To reactivate the auto-update process, type the command: <tt>gbibAutoUpdateOn</tt>
</P>

<p><b>Manual updates</b></p>
<P>
In addition to the auto-update process, you can manually update GBiB using the command line.
To do so, click on the black terminal screen and type the command:
<tt>updateBrowser</tt>.
This will run the script that updates all of the GBiB software and annotation tracks that you have
mirrored.
</P>

<P>
If GBiB stops working, there are a two ways you can fix it: 
<ul>
<li>Try updating GBiB using the <tt>updateBrowser</tt> command. This may help only if you 
previously turned off automatic updates. This update process may take several hours over a slow
Internet connection. 
<li>Re-download the GBiB .zip file and extract <b>only</b> the file
<em>gbib-root.vdi</em>. Do not extract and overwrite <em>gbib-data.vdi</em>, as it contains your 
personal track and session settings and mirrored tracks.

<A NAME="YourTracks"></A>
<div class="section">
<h1>Viewing Your Data</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<P>
In addition to providing access to the standard set of Genome Browser annotation tracks, GBiB
allows you to upload your own annotation tracks. These custom annotation tracks can be viewed in
the Genome Browser alongside the native UCSC tracks. Uploading your custom annotation tracks to 
GBiB is similar to uploading custom tracks to the main UCSC Genome Browser website. One big
difference is the ability to load local big data files without the need to host them on a separate
web server. For more information on taking advantage of this functionality, see the
<A HREF="#LocalTracks">Loading Local Big Data Tracks</A> section. </p>

<p>
To upload your own tracks, 
go to the <A HREF="../../cgi-bin/hgCustom">Add Custom Tracks</A> page. For more information on
uploading your own custom annotation tracks, please refer to our <A HREF="customTrack.html">
Custom Track help page</A>. </p>

<p>
In addition to custom tracks, you can use 
<A HREF="hgTrackHubHelp.html">Track Hubs</A> to easily view your data in the GBiB. Track Hubs are 
web-accessible directories of 
genomic data that can be viewed on the UCSC Genome Browser or GBiB. One strong advantage of track 
hubs is that they persist until you delete them. In contrast, custom tracks outside of saved 
sessions will automatically expire and be removed from the server after a few days. 
</P>

<A NAME="LocalTracks"></A>
<P><B>Loading Local Big Data Tracks</B>
<P>
Your computer can share directories with GBiB so that you can load big files without the need to
upload them to a web server. The big file formats are compressed, indexed, binary files, and include
<A HREF="bigBed.html">bigBed</A>, <A HREF="bigWig.html">bigWig</A>, <A HREF="bam.html">BAM</A>, and
<A HREF="vcf.html">VCF</A> files. Normally, one would have to place these types files onto a 
publicly accessible web server to upload them as a custom track. However, GBiB acts as its own web 
server, meaning that you can share local files with GBiB for easy uploading as a custom track.
</P>

<P>To allow GBiB to access one or more of your local folders, follow these steps:
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10>
<TR><TD>
<P><B>Step 1. Shut down the GBiB virtual machine</B>
<ol>
    <li>Close the black GBiB window.</li>
    <li>Select &quot;Send the shutdown signal&quot;.</li>
    <li>Confirm by clicking &quot;OK&quot;.</li>

<TABLE CELLPADDING=10>
<TR><TD>
<img src="../../images/gbib-shared.png" alt="GBiB Shared">
</TD><TD>
<P><B>Step 2. Allow VirtualBox access to one or more directories on your hard disk</B>
<ol>
	<li>Click on the &quot;browserbox&quot; entry in VirtualBox, then click on <i>Settings</i>.</li>
	<li>Click on <i>Shared Folders</i>.</li>
	<li>Click on the small &quot;+&quot; icon.</li>
	<li>Select a directory on your disk under <i>Folder Path / Other</i>.</li>
	<li>Select the checkbox to give &quot;Read-only&quot; access and make sure the checkbox for 
	&quot;Auto-mount&quot; is selected.</li>
	<li>Confirm by clicking &quot;OK&quot;.</li>
</ol>
</P>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>
Repeat these steps with other folders, as needed. Then, restart the browserbox by clicking the 
&quot;Start&quot; button again.
</P>

<P>
To check if your folders are shared, type this address into your web browser:
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:1234/folders" TARGET="_BLANK">http://127.0.0.1:1234/folders</a>. It should
show all shared folders. To obtain the bigDataUrl of any of the files in your shared folders, 
right-click on any file and select &quot;Copy link address&quot; You can now paste this URL into the
<A HREF="../../cgi-bin/hgCustom" TARGET="_BLANK">Add Custom Tracks</A> page.
</P>

<P><B><I>Example 1:</I></B></P>
<P>
Here is an example of a  custom track that loads a local BAM file (to customize this for
your own use, replace the URL with a pasted URL from your own machine):
<pre>track type=bam name=BamExample bigDataUrl=http://127.0.0.1:1234/folders/test/bamExample.bam</pre>
</P>

<P><B>Data and Track Conversion Tools</B></P>
<P>
The GBiB black terminal is a normal Linux command line interface. For easier use of the command
line, you can connect to the box from your computer with SSH. Your computer's terminal likely
supports copy/paste and is faster. To connect with SSH, open a terminal on your computer and type:
<pre>ssh browser@localhost -p 1235</pre> 
You will be prompted for a password when attempting to access the GBiB from your computer's command
line. The password is &quot;browser&quot;. You can use <tt>sudo</tt> for root access, which does not require 
a password. Because stock Windows computers do not have SSH installed, 
Windows users will have to use the GBiB terminal or install a third-party SSH client for Windows, 
such as the free software <A HREF="http://putty.org" TARGET="_BLANK">Putty</A>.
</P>

<P>
By default, GBiB includes a few of the basic UCSC tools, such as bedToBigBed, wigToBigWig,
samtools and tabix. These tools can be used to convert and manipulate your basic files into formats
that can be uploaded to GBiB as custom tracks. If you need other Genome Browser tools, type the
following command into the GBiB terminal window: <tt>gbibAddTools</tt>.
This command downloads and installs the full suite of command line tools provided by UCSC. Many of
these extra tools can be used to extract data and other useful information from your files, or to
convert them between various file types. A complete listing and description for all of these tools
can be found on UCSC's
<A HREF="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/FOOTER" TARGET="_BLANK">download server</A>.
You can use these tools to convert and extract data from your shared files with the standard
&quot;Read-only&quot; settings. However, if you would like to use these tools to modify files you've
shared with your GBiB, you will have to ensure that the &quot;Read-only&quot; access for VirtualBox is
turned off. To do so, follow the directions in Step 2 of the <a href="#LocalTracks">Loading
Local Big Data Tracks</a> section, but deselect the checkbox next to &quot;Read-only&quot;.
</P>

<P><B><I>Example 2:</I></B></P>
<P>
A BAM file must be indexed before it can be loaded into the browser. For example, to index a BAM 
file in a shared folder &quot;Documents&quot; on your hard disk, type:
<pre>
cd /folders/Documents
samtools index my.sorted.bam
</pre>
</P>

<P><B><I>Example 3:</I></B></P>
<P>
BED files must be converted to bigBed format to be loaded into the browser. For example, to convert 
a .bed file in a shared folder &quot;Documents&quot; on your hard disk to a .bigBed format file, 
type:
<pre>
cd /folders/Documents
fetchChromSizes hg19 &gt; hg19.sizes
bedToBigBed bedExample.txt hg19.sizes myBigBed.bb

<h1>Sharing Genome Browser in a Box with Colleagues</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<P>
By default, GBiB can be accessed only from the machine on which it is installed. This is done
to prevent others from accessing your data. You can, however, make your GBiB instance available for 
use by others. To open up external access to GBiB:
<ol>
<li>Stop GBiB.
<li>Select the browserbox machine in VirtualBox.
<li>Click &quot;Settings&quot;.
<li>Go to <i>Network &gt;&gt; Adapter 1 &gt;&gt; Advanced &gt;&gt; Port Forwarding</i>.
<li>Remove the address "127.0.0.1" from "Rule 1" by deleting it with the backspace key. 
</ol>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>In addition to
enabling port forwarding for VirtualBox, you may need to enable the port forwarding functionality
on your PC's firewall to allow others to access your GBiB. You will have to search online for 
instructions on how to enable this functionality for your PC's firewall.
</P>

<P>
Once you have opened external access to GBiB, your colleagues can access and use your GBiB instance 
by typing your IP address into their own Internet browser, followed by the :1234 port. <b>Keep 
in mind that once you have opened up GBiB for remote access, anyone who knows your IP address 
will be able to access your instance of GBiB and the files that you have shared with it.</b>
</P>
<P>
If you do not want your colleagues to configure track mirroring in your shared GBiB, you can use 
the commands <tt>gbibMirrorOff</tt> and <tt>gbibMirrorOn</tt> to disable or enable the
&quot;Mirror Tracks&quot; function in the menu.

<A NAME="UsrAcct"></A>
<div class="section">
<h1>User Accounts and Sessions</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<P>
When you start GBiB for the first time, you should create a user account
to allow you to start saving sessions. The <A HREF="../../cgi-bin/hgSession" target="_blank">
Session</A> tool allows you to configure your browser with specific track combinations, including
<A HREF="hgTracksHelp.html#CustomTracks">custom tracks</A>, and save the configuration options. You
can then share these sessions with others who use your GBiB instance. More information on creating,
saving, and sharing sessions can be found in the 
<A HREF="hgSessionHelp.html">Sessions User's Guide</A>.
User accounts and sessions on GBiB are separate from those maintainted on the 
<A HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/" TARGET="_BLANK">UCSC Genome Browser</A>. This means that user 
names and sessions that you create on your GBiB will not work with the main UCSC Genome Browser 
website, and vice versa.
</P>

<P>
Unfortunately, username recovery is not supported at this time. You can, however, recover lost
passwords. The system for recovering lost passwords on the GBiB is much different from that on the
Genome Browser, and requires access to the command line. Use the following steps to recover lost
passwords:
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the <A HREF="../../cgi-bin/hgLogin?hgLogin.do.displayLoginPage=1" TARGET="BLANK"
    >account login page</A>.</li>
    <li>Click on the &quot;Can't access your account?&quot; link on the login page.</li>
    <li>Select the &quot;I forgot my password. Send me a new one.&quot; option and enter your 
	username.</li>
    <li>An email will be sent to the Alpine email client included with VirtualBox.</li>
    <li>To access the email client, click into the GBiB's black terminal window.</li>
    <li>In this window, type <tt>mail</tt> and press enter, which will bring up the Alpine email

    <li>Select <tt>MESSAGE INDEX</tt> from the menu and press enter.</li>
    <li>Select the message with &quot;New temporary password...&quot; in the subject line.</li>
    <li>Log in using your username and this temporary password.</li>
    <li>After logging in, you will be prompted to create a new password.</li>
    <li>Once you are finished, exit the Alpine email client by pressing &quot;Q&quot; and
    then &quot;Y&quot;.</li>

This section addresses some common errors that you may encounter while setting up and installing 
GBiB. It is not intended as a comprehensive list.
If you run into issues not listed below, please email the UCSC Genome
Browser support mailing list at 
<A HREF="mailto:&#103;&#101;n&#111;m&#101;&#64;&#115;&#111;e.&#117;&#99;&#115;&#99;.e&#100;u">

<ul>
<li>VirtualBox Error: <em>VT-x/AMD-V hardware acceleration has been enabled, but is not operational.
Your 64-bit guest will fail to detect a 64-bit CPU and will not be able to boot.</em></li>
        <ul>
        <li>Some older entry-level laptops from around 2009-2011 (e.g. Toshiba Satellite U500) were
	    sold with CPUs that do not support virtualization.  These laptops cannot run GBiB.
	    The same applies to low-cost laptops (&quot;netbooks&quot;) with Intel Atom
	    processors.</li>
        <li>For some hardware, virtualization is supported, but
            deactivated in the BIOS. Reboot the computer, press F12 during boot to show the BIOS
            menu. Go to <em>BIOS Setup &gt;&gt; Virtualization Support &gt;&gt;
            Virtualization</em>, and check &quot;Enable Intel Virtualization Technology&quot;. 
	    (On some Dell systems, you may need to enable additional
	    virtualization options under the BIOS Setup. Go to 
	    <em>Virtualization Support &gt;&gt; Virtualization for Direct I/O</em>, and check 
	    &quot;Enable Virtualization for Direct I/O&quot;.) Exit and save. Restart the computer.
	    Please note that your BIOS virtualization options may be different from those described
	    here.</li>
        </ul>
<li>VirtualBox Error: <em>"Failed to open virtual machine located in... Trying to open a VM 
	config ...  which has the same UUID as an existing virtual machine."</em></li>
        <ul>
        <li>This happens if GBiB has already been downloaded and installed.</li>
        <li>Start VirtualBox, select the old browserbox virtual machine and choose
        <em>Machine &gt;&gt; Remove</em> in
	    the menu (Ctrl+R or &#8984;+R). When asked, choose &quot;Remove only&quot; so you still 
	    keep the old browserbox on your disk.</li>
        <li>Double-click the newly downloaded browserbox.vbox file or add it with
        <em>Machine &gt;&gt; Add</em>.</li>
        </ul>
<li>VirtualBox Error: <em>"Failed to open virtual machine located in... Cannot register the hard
disk ... because a hard disk ... already exists."</em></li>
        <ul>
        <li>This happens if you have previously downloaded and installed GBiB.</li>
        <li>Start VirtualBox, go to <em>File &gt;&gt; Virtual Media Manager</em> in the menu (Ctrl+D or &#8984;+D).
	<li>Select gbib-data.vdi and click &quot;Remove&quot;.</li>
        <li>Double-click the newly downloaded browserbox.vbox file or add it with
        <em>Machine &gt;&gt; Add</em>.</li>
        </ul>
<li>Genome Browser Error: <i>Couldn't connect to database hg19 on genome-mysql.cse.ucsc.edu as genomep</i>.</li>
        <ul>
        <li>This indicates that the virtual machine could not connect to the UCSC MySQL server.</li>
        <li>This error can be caused by a change of the IP address (e.g. on a Wi-Fi) that has not 
	    yet been picked
            up by the virtual machine. You can restart the box or run the command <tt>sudo ifup
	    --force eth0</tt> to reset the network connection.</li>
        <li>This can also be caused by a firewall that does not allow outgoing TCP data on port
            3306/MySQL. Please contact your institution's IT support staff to inquire about ways to 
	    open this port.</li>
        </ul>
