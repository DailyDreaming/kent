<h1>Overview</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">

Genome Genome Browser in a Box is a "virtual machine" of the entire UCSC genome browser
website that can be run on most PCs (Windows, Mac OSX or Linux).
It allows using the genome browser when your data is sensitive and
cannot be uploaded onto a web server or when your data files are too big 
for your webserver. <P>

The box does not include the UCSC genome annotation database of several terabytes.
The annotations are instead downloaded as needed from UCSC. None of your own data is
uploaded to UCSC.<p>

Depending on the distance to UCSC, remote access to the UCSC databases can be slow.
Therefore, Genome Browser in a Box includes a simple tool that allows downloading
("mirroring") of selected genome anotation tracks to your machine.

<h1>Requirements</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<ul>
        <li>A computer with support for virtualization, which is the case for most PCs sold after 2010
        <li>Around 10 GB space on your harddisk, more if you want to mirror many tracks
        <li>Administrator rights for your computer to install the virtualbox software
        <li>The firewall of your network has to allow outgoing
        connections on port 3306 (MySQL). Otherwise, only mirrored tracks are shown.
</ul>

<div class="section">
<h1>Installation</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
To install Genome Browser in a Box, first download the free software VirtualBox from <a
href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">virtualbox.org</a>. We have
tested version 4.3.6. Install it by following the instructions on the website.</P>

Then download the <a href="http://hgwdev.soe.ucsc.edu/~max/browserbox/browserbox.zip">
Genome Browser in a Box ZIP file </a> (~450 MB) and extract it.
<p>
Add the contents of the zip file to VirtualBox by double-clicking the file browserbox.vbox or
start virtualbox and select <i>Machine - Add</i> (&#8984;+A on Macs or
Ctrl-A on Linux/Windows) and open the file
browserbox.vbox that you just extracted.<P>

<img src="../../images/gbib-add.png"><p>

Finally, if needed, select "browserbox" on the left side menu of virtualbox and click the
big button "Start" in the symbol bar.<P> 
<img src="../../images/gbib-start.png">
<p>
The software will update itself every day, the first time you start it. You can
see the progress of the update on your screen ("Now updating the genome browser
programs"). Please wait until the update is done, it typically takes 10-30
seconds.  <p>
If error messages are displayed by VirtualBox or the Genome Browser, please
consult the <a href="#trouble">Troubleshooting</a> section.<p>

<div class="section">
<h1>Usage</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
Point your internet browser to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:1234">127.0.0.1:1234</a>. You should see the normal UCSC homepage. <p>

Note: even though you can use
http://localhost:1234, too, we recommend the 127.0.0.1:1234 address, as your browser
configuration might not be saved otherwise (most internet browsers do not send
cookies to "http://localhost"). You might want to bookmark this address.

<div class="section">
<h1>Improving the speed by keeping a local copy ("mirror") of tracks</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
If the browser is slow, then you are probably located too far away from UCSC.
The load time of the default tracks ranges from a few seconds on the US West Coast 
to up to 15 seconds from Europe. To download annotation tracks to your own
machine ("mirror"), click <i>Tools - Mirror Tracks</i> in the Genome Browser
menu of the box. The first start takes a while to load.  Select the tracks that
you typically use and click "Download".<p>

If you are unsure what to select, our recommendation is "Default tracks with
conservation tables, but no alignments". Depending on your network bandwidth,
the download can take several minutes or up to a few hours over an ADSL
line. 
During the download, the file browserbox-disk2.vmdk will grow.
Please wait until it is completed. You cannot use the Genome Browser in a Box during this
time. Once the download is complete, the default
tracks should load in less than three seconds for a typical locus.<P>

<h1>Loading local bam/bigWig/bigBed</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
Your computer can share directories with the Genome Browser in a Box so that you can load big files without 
the need to upload them to a webserver. <P>

To set this up, first stop the virtual machine by closing the black Genome Browser in a Box window, select "Send the shutdown signal" and confirm with "OK".<P>
<img src="../../images/gbib-powerOff.png">
<p>

Then you need to allow virtualbox access to one or more directories on your harddisk. To do this,
click on the "browserbox" entry in virtualbox, click on <i>Settings</i>, <i>Shared Folders</i>, 
<i>+</i>. Select a directory on your disk under <i>Folder Path / Other</i>. 
Select the checkbox to give access "Read-only" and make sure the checkbox for "Auto-mount" is selected.<P>
<img src="../../images/gbib-shared.png">
<P>

You can repeat this with other folders, if needed. Then, restart the browserbox by clicking the big "Start" button again.<p>

To check if your folders are shared, type this address into your web browser: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:1234/folders">http://127.0.0.1:1234/folders</a>. It should show all shared folders.<P>

To obtain the bigDataUrl of any of these files, do a right-click on it
and select "Copy link address". You can now paste this URL into your custom
track file.<P>

Example: Here is a custom track that loads a local bam file (you will have to replace the part after <tt>http://</tt> with a pasted URL from your own machine):<P>
<pre>track type=bam name=BamExample bigDataUrl=http://127.0.0.1:1234/folders/test/bamExample.bam</pre>

<div class="section">
<h1>Updating the Genome Browser in a Box</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
Start the box, click on the "black" screen with the terminal and type
<pre>
  sudo ./updateBrowser </pre>
This will update all the genome browser software and the annotation tracks that you mirrored.<p>

If for some reason your browser box does not start anymore one day, you can re-download
the zipfile and extract only the file browserbox-disk1.vmdk. Do not extract and overwrite
browserbox-disk2.vmdk, as it contains your track and session settings and mirrored
tracks.

<div class="section">
<h1>Data Conversion Command line Tools</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<a name="tools"></a>
The black terminal in the Genome Browser in a Box is a
normal linux command line. The root password is "browser". The box includes a few UCSC tools,
e.g. bedToBigBed and wigToBigWig, samtools and tabix. You can use them to index
bed/bam and wiggle files.<p>
For example, to index a BAM file in a shared folder "Documents" on your harddisk, type
<pre>
cd /folders/Documents
samtools index my.sorted.bam
</pre>
To convert a .bed file to .bigBed format, type
<pre>
cd /folders/Documents
fetchChromSizes hg19 > hg19.sizes
bedToBigBed bedExample.txt hg19.sizes myBigBed.bb
</pre>

If you need other Genome Browser tools, type the command "downloadTools" in the terminal. It will download
various command line tools provided by UCSC.<p>

For easier use of the command line, connect to the box from your computer with
SSH. It supports copy/paste and is faster. To connect with SSH, open a
terminal on your computer and type <tt>ssh browser@localhost -p 1235</tt>. The
password is "browser". You can use <tt>sudo</tt> for root access, it does not require a password.<P>

In this command line, you can also deactivate the automatic updates of the
Browser software and data (usually on startup and every four hours) with the
command "autoUpdateOff" and activate it again with "autoUpdateOn".  <p>

<h1>Sharing your Browser in a Box with colleagues</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<a name="share"></a>
You can open external access to your Browser in a Box by stopping it, selecting the browserbox machine in VirtualBox, clicking Settings and going to Network - Adapter 1 - Advanced - Port Forwarding. Remove the address "127.0.0.1" from "Rule 1"by deleting it with the backspace key. <P>
Your colleagues can then use the Browser in a Box by typing your IP address into their internet browser, followed by the :1234 port. <P>

<a name="trouble"></a>
<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<ul>
<li>Virtualbox Error: <i>VT-x/AMD-V hardware acceleration has been enabled, but is not operational. You 64-bit guest will fail to detect a 64-bit CPU and will not be able to boot.</i> 
</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Some older entry-level laptops from around 2009-2011 (e.g. Toshiba Satellite U500) were sold with CPUs that do not support virtualization.  These laptops cannot run the Genome Browser in a Box. The same applies to low-cost laptops called "netbooks" with Intel Atom processors. </li>
        <li>On some DELL Optiplex (e.g. Optiplex 960) laptops, virtualization is supported, but deactivated in the BIOS. Reboot the computer, press F12 during boot to show the BIOS menu. Go to "BIOS Setup", "Virtualization Support", "Virtualization", check "Enable Intel Virtualization Technology". Exit and save. Restart the computer.
        </ul>

<li>Virtualbox Error: <i>"Failed to open virtual machine located in... Trying to open a VM config ... which has the same UUID as an existing virtual machine. </i> 
        <ul>
        <li>This happens if you have already downloaded and installed Genome Browser in a Box before </li>
        <li>Start VirtualBox, select the old browserbox virtual machine and choose "Machine - Remove" in the menu (Ctrl+R or &#8984;+R). When asked, choose "Remove only" so you still keep the old browserbox on your disk.</li>
        <li>Double-click the newly downloaded browserbox.vbox file or add it with "Machine - Add"</li>
        </ul>

<li>Virtualbox Error: <i>"Failed to open virtual machine located in... Cannot register the hard disk ... because a hard disk ... already exists</i> 
        <ul>
        <li>This happens if you have already downloaded and installed Genome Browser in a Box before</li>
        <li>Start VirtualBox, go to "File - Virtual Media Manager" in the menu (Ctrl+D or &#8984;+D). Select browserbox-disk2.vmdk and click "Remove".</li>
        <li>Double-click the newly downloaded browserbox.vbox file or add it with "Machine - Add"</li>
        </ul>

<li>Genome Browser: <i>Couldn't connect to database hg19 on genome-mysql.cse.ucsc.edu as genomep</i></li>
        <ul>
        <li>This means that the virtual machine could not connect to the UCSC MySQL server</li>
        <li>It can be caused by a change of the IP address (e.g. on a wifi) which has not been picked up by the virtual machine yet. You can restart the box or run a command to reset the network like <tt>sudo ifup --force eth0</tt></li>
        <li>This can also be caused by a firewall that does not allow outgoing TCP data on port 3306/MySQL</li>
        </ul>
</li>
</ul>
