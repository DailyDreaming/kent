<div class="section">
<h1>What is Genome Browser in a Box?</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<p>
Genome Browser in a Box (GBiB) is a &quot;virtual machine&quot; of the entire UCSC Genome Browser 
website
that is designed to run on most PCs (Windows, Mac OSX or Linux). GBiB allows you to access much
of the UCSC Genome Browser's functionality from the comfort of your own computer. It is particularly
directed at individuals who want to use the Genome Browser toolset to view protected data.  
</p>

<p><b>Differences between GBiB and the Genome Browser</b></p>
<p>
While GBiB and the Genome Browser are similar in many ways, there are key differences.
In particular, GBiB makes it much easier to visualize sensitive or protected data. Prior to the 
introduction of GBiB, it was necessary to upload your data to the UCSC Genome Browser website or 
place the data files on a publicly accessible web server and supply the URL to UCSC in order
to view your own data with the Genome Browser. GBiB removes these requirements: none of your data 
must be uploaded to the UCSC servers, allowing you to use the Genome Browser on personal
datasets in situations where it's infeasible to load the data onto a public web server. 
</p>
<p>
Rather than installing the entire UCSC genome annotation database (several terabytes
of data), GBiB instead depends upon remote connections to various UCSC servers for much of its 
functionality and data. It connects to the UCSC 
<A HREF="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html" TARGET="_BLANK">download server</A>
to obtain genomic sequences, liftOver files, and many of the other large data files, and
connects to UCSC's <A HREF="mysql.html">public MySQL server</A> to download data displayed by the
various annotation tracks. A few Genome Browser tracks are unavailable on the UCSC public MySQL
server due to agreements with the data distributors (DECIPHER and LOVD Variants), and thus are 
unavailable for use with GBiB. 
</p>
<p>
The majority of protected data use in the research community currently focuses on the human genomes,
primarily the hg19 (GRCh37) assembly and with a growing body of annotation on the newer hg38 
(GRCh38) assembly. As a result, GBiB is currently
optimized for use with the hg19 assembly. Many other recent genome assemblies can
also be viewed, but access may be slower than for optimized assemblies. Access speed
may also be impacted by your connection distance from the UCSC server.
To improve performance in these situations, GBiB includes a simple tool that allows you to
download (&quot;mirror&quot;) selected genome annotation tracks to your machine. You can 
find more information about this tool in the 
<A HREF="#GbibMirroring">Improving Speed and Performance</A> section.

<A NAME="GetStarted"></A>
<div class="section">
<h1>Getting Started: Setting up Genome Browser in a Box</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<p><b>System requirements</b></p>
<p>
GBiB will run on most modern PCs and major operating systems that meet these basic requirements: 
  <ul>
    <li>The computer must support virtualization (common for most PCs sold after 2010).</li>

    <li>A compatible version of the <A HREF="https://www.virtualbox.org/" 
    TARGET="_BLANK">VirtualBox</A> software (version 4.3.6 or higher)
    must be installed. This software is free to use in many situations. See the VirtualBox wiki
    for <A HREF="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Licensing_FAQ" 
    TARGET="_BLANK">licensing terms and conditions</A> and 
    <A HREF="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" TARGET="_blank">installation</A> 
    instructions. You must have administrator rights for your computer to install 
    VirtualBox.</li>

    <li>The computer hard disk must have at least 20 GB of free space (more if you plan to mirror 
    many tracks).</li>

    <li>Your network firewall must allow connections on the following ports:
      <ul>
        <li>Port 3306, used by MySQL (to include tracks not local to your computer)</li>
	<li>TCP port 873, used by rsync (to download track data)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Installation</b></p>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>Confirm that your system meets the above requirements.</li>
    <li>Download GBiB from the <a href="//genome-store.ucsc.edu/" 
        target="_blank">Genome Browser store</a> (see <A HREF="#License">Licensing Information</A>).
        Due to the large size of the <em>gbib.zip</em> product file, the download time may range 
	from 30 minutes to a few hours depending on your Internet connection speed and distance 
        from UCSC. </li>
    <li>Extract the contents of the <em>gbib.zip</em> file (three files). If desired, the extracted 
	files can be moved to a different directory on your computer, as long as all three files 
	reside in the same directory and are not renamed. 
	<b>Extraction notes:</b> On OSX, do not use the command line tool &quot;unzip&quot; to 
	extract the files; instead double-click on the <em>gbib.zip</em> file in the Finder window. 
	On Windows, you must use a third-party tool such as <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" 
	target="_blank">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/" target="_blank">WinRAR</a> to 
	extract the <em>gbib.zip</em> contents, as the file size exceeds the capabilities of the 
	standard Windows extraction tool.</li>
    <li>Add GBiB to VirtualBox:
      <ul>
        <li>Double-click on the <em>browserbox.vbox</em> file  extracted from <em>gbib.zip</em>
            <B>OR</B></li> 
        <li>Start VirtualBox, select <em>Machine &gt;&gt; Add</em>, and open the file 
	    <em>browserbox.vbox</em>.</li>
	    <p><img src="../../images/gbib-add.png"></p>
      </ul></li>
  </ol></p>


<p>
If VirtualBox or the Genome Browser displays an error message during the installation
process, consult the <a href="#Trouble">Troubleshooting</a> section.

<div class="section">
<h1>Starting and Using Genome Browser in a Box</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<p><b>Starting GBiB</b></p>
<p>
To start using GBiB with VirtualBox:
  <ol>
    <li>Start VirtualBox. </li>
    <li>Select &quot;browserbox&quot; on the VirtualBox lefthand menu (see 
        "<A HREF="#GetStarted">Getting Started</A>" to add GBiB to VirtualBox). </li>
    <li>Click the &quot;Start&quot; button in the VirtualBox toolbar. 
        <p><img src="../../images/gbib-start.png"></p> 
	This will open a black GBiB terminal window with a Linux command line 
	interface:
	<p><img src="../../images/gbib-terminal.png"></p></li>
    <li>Open an Internet browser window to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:1234" 
	TARGET="_BLANK">127.0.0.1:1234</a>. We recommend using this URL instead of 
	http://localhost:1234, because most Internet browsers do not send cookies to 
	&quot;http://localhost&quot;, which are required to save your browser configuration between 
	sessions. You may want to bookmark 127.0.0.1:1234 for quick future access. </li>
  </ol></p>

<p>
If you have correctly set up GBiB, your Internet browser should display the UCSC Genome
Bioinformatics home page. From this page, you can start using GBiB as you would the public Genome 
Browser website. Consult the UCSC Genome Browser <a href="hgTracksHelp.html">User's Guide</a> for 
introductory information on using the Genome Browser tools.
</p>
<a name="GbibStop"></a>
<p><b>Stopping GBiB</b></p>
<p>
To shut down the GBiB machine (for example, to change configuration options):
  <ol>
    <li>Close the GBiB terminal window.</li>
    <li>Select &quot;Send the shutdown signal&quot;.</li>
    <li>Confirm by clicking &quot;OK&quot;.</p>
    <p><img src="../../images/gbib-powerOff.png" alt="GBiB Power Off"></li></p>
  </ol></p>

<A NAME="GbibMirroring"></A>
<div class="section">
<h1>Improving Speed and Performance</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<P>
Under certain circumstances the speed and response time of GBiB may be less than optimal.
This section offers suggestions for improving the performance of your GBiB installation.</p>

<p><b>Increasing GBiB RAM</b></p>
<p>
As a first measure for performance improvment, try increasing the amount of RAM that GBiB 
is allowed to use. By default, this limit is set to 1 GB (1024 MB). If your machine
has enough RAM installed, you may want to increase the GBiB RAM to 2, 4, or even 8 GB. This will 
usually improve the system responsiveness. To increase the RAM limit: 
  <ol>
    <li>Shut down the GBiB machine (<a href="#GbibStop">Stopping GBiB</a>). </li>
    <li>On the VirtualBox Manager window, click <em>Settings &gt;&gt; System</em>. </li>
    <li>Move the memory slider to the value of your choice, then click &quot;OK&quot;.</p> 
	<p><img src="../../images/gbib-RAM.png" alt="GBiB RAM"></p></li>
  </ol></p>

<p><b>Using the GBiB mirror tool</b></p>
<p>
If your GBiB performance is still slow after increasing the RAM, you may be located too far from 
UCSC.
The load time of default tracks ranges from a few seconds on the west coast of the United States
to as much as 7 seconds from Europe. In this situation, you may want to use the GBiB mirror tool 
to download (&quot;mirror&quot;) tracks to your machine, which will greatly increase the access 
speed for those tracks. To use the mirror tool: 
  <ol>
    <li>Click <em>Tools &gt;&gt; Mirror Tracks</em> in the Genome Browser menu. The first time you 
	open the mirror tool, the page may take a while to load. </li>
    <li>Select the tracks that you typically use by checking the boxes next to the track names.</li>
    <li>Click <em>Download</em>. </li>
  </ol>
<p>
In addition to downloading entire track sets, you can also download individual
subtracks. The file size of each track is listed next to the track name. If you are unsure of which 
tracks to select, we recommend the option <em>Default tracks with conservation tables, but no 
alignments</em>. When downloading large tracks, keep in mind that you cannot delete these tracks 
and the related data from GBiB once you have
downloaded them. If you find that you've started downloading the wrong track or a track that is too
large for your machine, you can cancel the download at any point by clicking <em>Cancel Download 
Now</em>. </p>

<p>
Depending on your network bandwidth, the download can 
take several minutes or up to a few hours over a DSL line. During the download, the file 
<em>gbib-data.vdi</em> will grow in size, and you will not be able to use GBiB. Once the download is
complete, the default tracks should load in less than three seconds for a typical genomic position.
</p>

<p><b>Offline mode</b></p>
<P>GBiB has an offline mode that is particularly useful when you want to
ensure that GBiB no longer connects to the Internet once the initial download and setup are complete
(for instance, to comply with corporate IT
policy). Before going offline, first mirror all the tracks that you need, then click on 
the GBiB terminal window and type the command: <tt>gbibOffline</tt>.
This command will remove GBiB's network access to the UCSC MySQL server and download servers.</p>
<p>
Once GBiB is in offline mode, the Genome Browser will display an error message if you attempt to
access a data file not located on your local disk; therefore, we do not recommend this option for 
general use. To reactivate Internet access, click on the GBiB terminal window 
and type the command: <tt>gbibOnline</tt>.
</P>

<A NAME="UpdatingGbib"></A>
<div class="section">
<h1>Updating Genome Browser in a Box</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<p>
The software that supports the UCSC Genome Browser is updated every three weeks. These updates
include new features and bug fixes for existing features. The track data, on the other hand,
are not updated on a regular basis. New tracks and updates to existing tracks are released as
they pass UCSC's quality assurance process. The only exceptions to this are GenBank-based tracks, 
including RefSeq Genes, GenBank mRNAs, and others, which are updated weekly through an
automatic process.
</p>

<p><b>Automatic updates</b></p>
<p>
By default, GBiB is configured to automatically update its files, including software and tracks
that you have mirrored. The updates will not affect your custom tracks, user accounts or sessions.
We recommend that you leave the auto-update process turned on if Internet connection speed is not 
an issue, to ensure that you receive all the latest software features and bug fixes, as well as 
updates to your mirrored tracks. </p>

<p>
If you are using a DSL line, we recommend turning off automatic updates. Over a slow internet 
connection, the GBiB update may take several hours to complete, during which time the
software will be unusable.
To turn off the auto-update process, start GBiB, then type the command <tt>gbibAutoUpdateOff</tt>
in the GBiB terminal window. 
<p>
The auto-update process can be reactivated by typing the command <tt>gbibAutoUpdateOn</tt>.
</p>

<a name="ManualUpdates"></a>
<p><b>Manual updates</b></p>
<p>
In addition to the auto-update process, you can manually update GBiB.  
To do so, start GBiB and type the command <tt>updateBrowser</tt> in the GBiB 
terminal window.
This will run the script that updates the GBiB software and any annotation tracks that you have
mirrored. A manual update is sometimes an effective solution when GBiB is functioning
incorrectly or stops working (see <a href="#Trouble">Troubleshooting</a> for more information). 
</p>

<A NAME="YourTracks"></A>
<div class="section">
<h1>Viewing Your Own Data</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<p>
In addition to providing access to the standard set of Genome Browser annotation tracks
generated by UCSC, GBiB allows you to upload your own data in the form of custom 
annotation tracks. These tracks can be
viewed in the Genome Browser alongside the native UCSC tracks. </p>
<p>
Uploading your custom
annotation tracks to GBiB is similar in many ways to the process used for the 
public UCSC Genome Browser website (see <a href="#gbibCustomTracks">Loading custom annotation 
tracks</a>). One big difference, however, is that GBiB has a built-in web server that
can communicate directly with your computer. 
This eliminates the Genome Browser requirement that local big data files 
be hosted on a separate publicly accessible web server. 
As a result, your data remains private to your own computer, and will 
not be available to others unless you grant them access (see <a href="#LocalTracks">Loading local 
big data tracks and track hubs</a>). </p>
<p>
In addition to custom tracks, you can use <a href="hgTrackHubHelp.html">track hubs</a> 
to easily view your data in GBiB.
Track hubs are web-accessible directories of genomic data that offer a broader set of
configuration and integration features than custom annotation tracks. One strong advantage of track 
hubs is that they persist until you delete them, in contrast to custom tracks outside of saved 
sessions that will automatically expire and be removed from the server after a few days. As
with big data tracks, the GBiB built-in web server circumvents the requirement that track
hubs be uploaded to a public accessible server prior to viewing. </p>

<a name="gbibCustomTracks"></a>
<p><b>Loading custom annotation tracks</b>
<p>
Custom tracks containing smaller data sets can be uploaded to GBiB through the 
<a href="../../cgi-bin/hgCustom">Add Custom Tracks</A> page. 
For more information on generating and uploading custom tracks, see the 
<a href="customTrack.html">Custom Track help page</A>. </p>

<a name="LocalTracks"></a>
<p><b>Loading local big data tracks and track hubs</b>
<p>
For improved display performance in the Genome Browser, big data sets are typically stored in a 
compressed, indexed binary file format such as 
<A HREF="bigBed.html">bigBed</A>, <A HREF="bigWig.html">bigWig</A>, <A
HREF="bam.html">BAM</A>, or
<A HREF="vcf.html">VCF</A> that contains the data at several resolutions. 
Unlike custom tracks, in which the entire data set is loaded at once, track hubs
transmit only the data for the region currently displayed. 
In order to display data in one of these formats, the Genome Browser requires the data files to be
uploaded to a publicly accessible web server. However, unlike the Genome Browser, GBiB does not 
require local big data files to be loaded onto a separate web server. 

<p>To allow GBiB to access one or more of your local folders, follow these steps:
<table cellpadding=10>
<tr><td>
<p><b>Step 1. </b>Shut down the GBiB virtual machine (<a href="#GbibStop">Stopping GBiB</a>)
<p><b>Step 2. </b>Allow VirtualBox access to one or more directories on your hard disk
  <ol>
    <li>Click on the &quot;browserbox&quot; entry in the VirtualBox Manager window, then click 
	<em>Settings</em>.</li>
    <li>Click on <em>Shared Folders</em>.</li>
    <li>Click on the small &quot;+&quot; icon.</li>
    <li>Select a directory on your disk under <em>Folder Path / Other</em>.</li>
    <li>Select the checkbox to give &quot;Read-only&quot; access and make sure the checkbox for 
	&quot;Auto-mount&quot; is selected.</li>
    <li>Confirm by clicking &quot;OK&quot;.</li>
    <li>Repeat these steps with other folders, as needed.</li>
    <li>When you are finished, restart GBiB by clicking the &quot;Start&quot; button again.
  </ol></p>
</td><td>
<img src="../../images/gbib-shared.png" alt="GBiB Shared">
</td></tr></table>
<p>
To check if your folders are shared, type this address into your web browser:
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:1234/folders" TARGET="_BLANK">http://127.0.0.1:1234/folders</a>. It should
show all shared folders. To obtain the bigDataUrl of any of the files in your shared folders, 
right-click on any file and select &quot;Copy link address&quot;. You can now paste this URL into 
the <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgCustom" target="_blank">Add Custom Tracks</a> page.
</p>

<p><em>Example 1: Loading a local BAM custom track</em></p>
<p>
Here is an example of a  custom track that loads a local BAM file (to customize this for
your own use, replace the URL with a pasted URL from your own machine):
    <pre>track type=bam name=BamExample bigDataUrl=http://127.0.0.1:1234/folders/test/bamExample.bam
    </pre> </p>

<p><b>Data and track conversion tools</b></p>
<p>
The GBiB terminal is a normal Linux command line interface. For easier use of the command
line, you can connect to the GBiB machine from your computer with ssh. Among other things, your 
computer's terminal likely supports copy/paste and is faster. To connect with ssh: 
  <ol> 
    <li>Open a terminal on your computer and type:
        <tt>ssh browser@localhost -p 1235</tt> </li> 
    <li>You will be prompted for a password when attempting to access the GBiB from your computer's
	command line. The password is &quot;browser&quot;. Alternatively you can use <tt>sudo</tt> 
	for root access, which does not require a password. 
  </ol></p>
<p>
Because stock Windows computers do not have ssh installed, Windows users will have to use the 
GBiB terminal or install a third-party ssh client for Windows, such as the free software 
<a href="http://putty.org" target="_blank">Putty</a>. </p>

<p>
By default, GBiB includes a few of the commonly used UCSC file manipulation tools, such as bedToBigBed, 
wigToBigWig, samtools and tabix. These tools can be used to convert and manipulate your basic files into formats
that can be uploaded to GBiB as custom tracks. If you need other Genome Browser tools, type the
following command into the GBiB terminal window: <tt>gbibAddTools</tt>.
This command downloads and installs the full suite of command line tools provided by UCSC. Many of
these extra tools can be used to extract data and other useful information from your files, or to
convert them between various file types. A complete listing and description for all of these tools
can be found on UCSC's
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/FOOTER" target="_blank">download server</a>.
<p>
You can use these tools to convert and extract data from your shared files with the standard
&quot;Read-only&quot; settings. However, if you would like to to modify files you've
shared with your GBiB, you will have to ensure that the &quot;Read-only&quot; access for VirtualBox is
turned off. To do so, follow the directions in Step 2 of the <a href="#LocalTracks">Loading
local big data tracks</a> section, but deselect the checkbox next to &quot;Read-only&quot;.
</p>

<p><em>Example 2: Indexing a local BAM file</em></p>
<p>
A BAM file must be indexed before it can be loaded into the browser. For example, to index a BAM 
file in a shared folder &quot;Documents&quot; on your hard disk, type:
    <pre>
    cd /folders/Documents
    samtools index my.sorted.bam
    </pre> </p>

<p><em>Example 3: Using a format conversion tool</em></p>
<p>
BED files must be converted to bigBed format to be loaded into the browser. For example, to convert 
a .bed file in a shared folder &quot;Documents&quot; on your hard disk to a .bigBed format file, 
type:
    <pre>
    cd /folders/Documents
    fetchChromSizes hg19 &gt; hg19.sizes
    bedToBigBed bedExample.txt hg19.sizes myBigBed.bb
    </pre></p>

By default, GBiB can be accessed only from the machine on which it is installed. This is done
to prevent others from accessing your data. You can, however, make your GBiB instance available for 
use by others. To open up external access to GBiB:
    <ol>
      <li>Shut down the GBiB machine (<a href="#GbibStop">Stopping GBiB</a>). </li>
      <li>Select the browserbox machine in the VirtualBox lefthand menubar.</li>
      <li>Select <em>Machine &gt;&gt; Settings</em> in the VirtualBox menu to display the Settings

      <li>Go to <em>Network &gt;&gt; Adapter 1 &gt;&gt; Advanced &gt;&gt; Port Forwarding</em>.</li>
      <li>Click &quot;Rule 1&quot; to select it, then click the &quot;minus&quot; icon on the
          righthand side of the window to remove this rule. Alternatively, on some versions you can           remove the address &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; from &quot;Rule 1&quot; by deleting it with the 
	  backspace key. </li>
      <li>Click &quot;OK&quot;.</li>
    </ol></p>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>In addition to
enabling port forwarding for VirtualBox, you may need to enable the port forwarding functionality
on your PC's firewall to allow others to access your GBiB. You will have to search online for 
instructions on how to enable this functionality for your PC's firewall.
</P>

<P>
Once you have opened external access to GBiB, your colleagues can access and use your GBiB instance 
by typing your IP address into their own Internet browser, followed by the :1234 port. <b>Keep 
in mind that once you have opened up GBiB for remote access, anyone who knows your IP address 
will be able to access your instance of GBiB and the files that you have shared with it.</b>
</P>

The Session tool allows you to take a snapshot of your browser configured with 
specific track combinations, including <a href="hgTracksHelp.html#CustomTracks">custom tracks</a>. 
A browser  session can be saved for future use or shared with others who use your GBiB instance. 
To use the Session tool, you must first create a user account. User accounts and sessions on GBiB 
are separate from those maintained on the UCSC Genome Browser public website. Because of this, user 
names and sessions that you create on GBiB cannot be used with the main UCSC Genome Browser 
website, and vice versa. More information on creating a user account and creating, saving, and 
sharing sessions can be found in the <a href="hgSessionHelp.html">Sessions User's Guide</a>.
</p>

<p>
Username recovery on accounts is not supported at this time; however, you can recover a lost
password. The system for recovering lost passwords on GBiB is much different from that on the
Genome Browser, and requires access to the command line. To recover a lost password:
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgLogin?hgLogin.do.displayLoginPage=1" 
	target="blank">account login page</a>. </li>
    <li>Click on the &quot;Can't access your account?&quot; link on the login page.</li>
    <li>Select the &quot;I forgot my password. Send me a new one.&quot; option and enter your 
	username.</li>
    <li>An email message will be sent to the Alpine email client included with VirtualBox.</li>
    <li>To access the email client, click on the GBiB terminal window.</li>
    <li>In this window, type <tt>mail</tt> and press &quot;enter&quot;, which will bring up the 
	Alpine email client.</li>
    <li>Select <tt>MESSAGE INDEX</tt> from the menu and press enter.</li>
    <li>Select the message with &quot;New temporary password...&quot; in the subject line.</li>
    <li>Log in using your username and this temporary password.</li>
    <li>After logging in, you will be prompted to create a new password.</li>
    <li>Once you are finished, exit the Alpine email client by pressing &quot;Q&quot; and
    then &quot;Y&quot;.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>
Please be aware that anyone with access to your username and the command line interface of your GBiB
can change your password.

<h1>Troubleshooting Common Problems</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<p>
This section addresses some common errors and problems that you may encounter while setting up and 
installing 
GBiB. It is not intended as a comprehensive list. If you experience a problem not listed below, 
please email the UCSC Genome Browser public support mailing list at 
<A HREF="mailto:&#103;&#101;n&#111;m&#101;&#64;&#115;&#111;e.&#117;&#99;&#115;&#99;.e&#100;u">
&#103;&#101;n&#111;m&#101;&#64;&#115;&#111;e.&#117;&#99;&#115;&#99;.e&#100;u</A>. Note that
messages sent to this address are publicly accessible.
<p>
<b>VirtualBox Error: </b> &quot;<em>VT-x/AMD-V hardware acceleration has been enabled, but is not 
operational. Your 64-bit guest will fail to detect a 64-bit CPU and will not be able to 
boot.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>
<em>Solution 1: </em>Some older entry-level laptops from around 2009-2011 (e.g. Toshiba Satellite 
U500) were sold with CPUs that do not support virtualization. These laptops cannot run GBiB.
          The same applies to low-cost laptops (&quot;netbooks&quot;) with Intel Atom
	  processors.
<p>
<em>Solution 2: </em>On some hardware, virtualization is supported but deactivated in the BIOS. 
Here is one example of how virtualization support is activated on some hardware. Note that your BIOS
virtualization options may differ from those described here.
    <ol>
      <li>Reboot the computer and press F12 during boot to show the BIOS menu. </li>
      <li>Go to <em>BIOS Setup &gt;&gt; Virtualization Support &gt;&gt;
          Virtualization</em> and check &quot;Enable Intel Virtualization Technology&quot;. 
	  On some Dell systems, you may need to enable additional virtualization options under the 
	  BIOS Setup. Go to <em>Virtualization Support &gt;&gt; Virtualization for Direct I/O</em> 
	  and check &quot;Enable Virtualization for Direct I/O&quot;. </li>
      <li>Exit and save, then restart the computer.</li>
    </ol></p>

<p>
<b>VirtualBox Error: </b>&quot;<em>Failed to open virtual machine located in... Trying to open a VM 
	config ...  which has the same UUID as an existing virtual machine.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>
<em>Solution: </em> This error occurs if GBiB has been previously downloaded and
installed. To resolve this problem:
    <ol>
      <li>Start VirtualBox.</li>
      <li>Select the currently installed version of browserbox from the lefthand column.</li>
      <li>Select <em>Machine &gt;&gt; Remove</em> (Ctrl+R or &#8984;+R) in the VirtualBox menu. 
	  When asked, choose &quot;Remove only&quot; to retain the old browserbox version on your 
          disk.</li>
      <li>Double-click the newly downloaded <em>browserbox.vbox</em> file or add it with
          the <em>Machine &gt;&gt; Add</em> menu option.</li>
    </ol></p>

<p>
<b>VirtualBox Error: </b>&quot;<em>Failed to open virtual machine located in... Cannot register 
the hard disk ... because a hard disk ... already exists.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>
<em>Solution: </em> This error occurs if GBiB has been previously downloaded and installed. To 
resolve this problem:
    <ol>
      <li>Start VirtualBox.</li>
      <li>Select <em>File &gt;&gt; Virtual Media Manager</em> (Ctrl+D or &#8984;+D) in the
          VirtualBox menubar.
      <li>Select <em>gbib-data.vdi</em> and click &quot;Remove&quot;.</li>
      <li>Double-click the newly downloaded <em>browserbox.vbox</em> file or add it with
          <em>Machine &gt;&gt; Add</em> menu option.</li>
    </ol></p>

<p>
<b>Genome Browser Error: </b> &quot;<em>Couldn't connect to database hg19 on 
genome-mysql.cse.ucsc.edu as genomep.</em>&quot;
<p>
<em>Solution 1: </em>This indicates that the virtual machine could not connect to the UCSC MySQL 
server. This error can be caused by a change of the IP address (e.g. on a wifi connection) that has 
not yet been picked up by the virtual machine. In this situation, you can restart the box or run 
the command <tt>sudo ifup --force eth0</tt> to reset the network connection.</p>
<p>
<em>Solution 2: </em>Alternatively, this error may be generated when the firewall does not allow 
outgoing TCP data on port 3306/MySQL. In this case, contact your institution's IT support staff to 
inquire about ways to open this port. </p>
<p>
<b>Problem: </b>GBiB is functioning incorrectly or stops working.</p>
<p>
<em>Solution 1: </em>If you have previously turned off automatic updates, your software or data 
may need updating. Try <a href="#ManualUpdates">manually updating</a> GBiB. This update process may 
take several hours over a slow Internet connection. </p>
<p>
<em>Solution 2: </em>Re-download the <em>gbib.zip</em> file and extract <b>only</b> the file
<em>gbib-root.vdi</em>. Place this file in the same directory with the files extracted from
your original GBiB installation. Do not extract and overwrite <em>gbib-data.vdi</em> -- it contains 
your personal track and session settings and mirrored tracks. </p>
