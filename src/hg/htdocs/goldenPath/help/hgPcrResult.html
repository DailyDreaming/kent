<P>
This track shows the In Silico PCR alignment(s) of your primers to the
genome assembly.  The result is shown as a single block including the
primers and the sequence between them.  Differences between the primer 
sequences and the reference genome sequence are indicated by primer 
base values at base level view, or red vertical lines when zoomed out</P>
