<P>
This track shows the In Silico PCR alignment(s) of your primers to the
genome assembly.  The result is shown as a single block including the
primers and the sequence between them.  Differences between the primer 
sequences and the reference genome sequence are indicated by primer 
base values at base level view, or red vertical lines when zoomed out.</P>
<P>
In the sequence displayed on the details page, the link in the fasta 
header goes to the Genome Browser at the given position.  Between the 
start and end coordinates, there is a '+' if the primers matched the 
forward strand of the reference genome sequence, or a '-' if they 
matched the reverse strand.  Bases are capitalized where the primer 
sequences and reference genome sequence agree.  When a primer base does 
not match the genome sequence, the genomic base value is shown in lower 
case.</P>
