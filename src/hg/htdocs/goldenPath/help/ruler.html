<P>
The Base Position feature in the Genome Browser annotations track image shows the
genomic coordinates of the displayed region and -- when zoomed-in to the base
level -- the base composition of the sequence underlying the annotation tracks
display. Click the arrow to the left of the base display to show the base 
complement. 
To toggle between dense and full display mode, click anywhere on the base
composition line.
<P>
In dense display mode, clicking anywhere on the genome coordinate line will 
zoom-in the display by threefold, centered on the coordinate of the click. 
In full display mode, the track shows three frames of translation. 
Start codons (the first methionines) are displayed in  green and labeled 
&quot;M&quot;; stop codons are colored red and labeled with &quot;*&quot;. 
Codons within or on the boundaries of gaps are colored black and labeled with 
an &quot;X&quot; to indicate an 
error (e.g. a truncated codon). All other codons are shown in alternating shades 
of gray to indicate codon boundaries and are labeled by the amino acids 
they represent. To view the translation on the reverse strand, click the arrow 
to complement the base display.
