<P>
The Base Position feature in the Genome Browser annotations track image shows the
genomic coordinates of the displayed region and -- when zoomed-in to the base
level -- the base composition of the sequence underlying the annotation tracks
display. Click the arrow to the left of the base display to show the base 
complement. 
<P>
In dense display mode, clicking anywhere on the genome coordinate line will 
zoom-in the display by threefold, centered on the coordinate of the click. 
To toggle the track between dense and full mode, click anywhere on the base
composition line.
<P>
In full display mode, the track shows three frames of translation. 
Start codons (the first methionines) are displayed in  green; stop codons are 
colored red and labeled with &quot;*&quot;. Codons within or on the boundaries 
of gaps are colored black and labeled with an &quot;X&quot; to indicate an 
error (e.g. a truncated codon). All other codons are shown in alternating shades 
of gray to indicate codon boundaries. Codons are labeled by the amino acids 
they represent. To view the translation on the reverse strand, click the arrow 
to complement the base display.
