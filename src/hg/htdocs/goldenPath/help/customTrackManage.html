track data.</LI>
<LI> The <B>Description</B> field is completed with the &quot;description&quot; 
attribute from the track line, if present. If no description is included

has been supplied a description page. It is B if there is no track 
description associated with the track.</LI>
<LI> The <B>Items</B> column shows the number of data items in the file. Tracks 
lacking individual items (e.g. wiggle format data) will not show an item 
count.</LI>
<LI> The <B>Pos</B> column shows the chromosome of the default position provided in 
the data file using the position attribute of the track line. Clicking this 
link takes you to the Genome Browser at the specified position (note: only 
the chromosome name is shown in the <B>Pos</B> column). If there is no default 
position, this column shows the chromosome of the first data item. Tracks 
lacking individual items (e.g. wiggle format data) will not show a <B>Pos</B>.</LI>
