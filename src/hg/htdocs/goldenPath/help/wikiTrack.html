<H3>Description</H3>
<P>
The Wiki Track contains user added annotations.  There is no curation
of the annotations.  User's can add annotations after completing a
login to the <A HREF="http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/"
TARGET=_blank>genomewiki</A> system.  Notations can be attached to
UCSC genes, or to genome locations.
</P>
<P>
To add notes to a UCSC gene, click on the gene in the browser display, then
via the <em>Sequence and Links to Tools and Databases</em> section,
specifically the link <em>User annotations</em>.  Notes added to genes will
appear in the Wiki Track covering that gene locus.  If that gene name
has additional locii, it will appear multiple times in the Wiki Track.
</P>
<P>
Notes can also be added to genome locations by clicking on the red item
displayed at the top of the Wiki Track.  The position annotated is the
position of the current genome browser view.
</P>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The genome browser entry forms for annotations are simple text entry
forms.  The text submitted is sent to the <em>genomewiki</em> system
for archival storage.  The notes will be tagged with a date/time stamp,
and the user's wiki login name.  Notes can be corrected by editing
the Wiki article.

<H3>Policies</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The UCSC Genome Browser group reserves the right to remove any annotations.
<LI>There is no curation of the annotations.  User's with areas of expertise
	are welcome and encouraged to monitor annotations of interest and
	add notes of correction as appropriate.  Use the page watch
	function in the genomewiki to monitor changes to annotations.
<LI>The user starting the initial annotation is the "Owner" of the annotation.
<LI>Annotation "Owners" have deletion privileges.
<LI>Deletion merely removes an item from appearing on the Wiki Track.
	The actual annotation continues to exist in the genomewiki system,
	with a note attached that it has been deleted.
<LI>Currently annotations are enabled only on Human March 2006 Hg18, and
	Mouse July 2007 Mm9 genome browsers.
