<div class="section">
	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<div class="sectionContent">
	   <p>The multi-region display allows users the ability to &quot;slice&quot; up
              their normal track viewing experience into a variety of different modes:
              exon, gene, or user defined BED coordinates, and visualize 
              the track annotations only in those regions, effectively removing
              the intergenic and intron regions from the viewing window.
        
           <p>In addition, for the human assemblies hg19 and hg38, the multi-region view
              also supports embedding a haplotype chromosome on top of it's
              reference sequence in order to visualize the differences between the haplotype
              sequence and the reference sequence.
        
           <p># List some limits on the multi regions
              <ul>
                 <li>Can only filter on predefined exon or gene type, not just whatever
                     track you are looking at

<a name="GetStarted"></a>
<div class="section">
	<h1>Getting Started: Gene or Exon Only View</h1>
	<div class="sectionContent">
	<p>Follow these instructions to display regions only containing genes
           or exons:

	<p>
	<b>Step 1. Pick a genome assembly and region</b><br>
           Select the genome assembly you would like to view just as when normally
           viewing an assembly, by using the top menu's Genomes link. If you would like
           view exon or gene only mode for your assembly hub, navigate to it's browser
           display as normal.

        <p>Once an assembly has been selected, either search for a gene of interest 
           or select a region to view using the Genome Browser search bar.
        	
        <p>
	<b>Step 2. Configure the multi-region view</b><br>
	   <ul>
              <li>Click <button type="button">multi-region</button> while on the track display
                  page to bring up the multi-region configuration window. <br># image needed here
                  for both where to click and the window
                  <img style="border: 1px solid black; display: block;"
                       src="">
                  <img style="border: 1px solid black; display: block;"
                       src="">
              <li>By default the <b>Show single-chromosome view</b> will be selected. If you
                  would like to return to the plain Genome Browser display you can choose this
                  option.
              <li>Now select either <b>Show exons</b> or <b>genes using Ensembl/RefSeq/Gencode etc</b>
                  depending on whether you would like to view intronic regions (genes view)
                  or non intronic (exons view). Note that both views remove all intergenic regions, 
                  except for the number of bases noted in the <b>padding</b> field, pads each exon 
                  or gene with the specified number of bases on either side of the item. Thus if 
                  the exon only view is selected the padding bases will be intron or intergenic 
                  while if gene only view is selected the padding bases will be all intergenic.
              <li>Select the <b>Highlight alternating regions in multi-region view</b> box if
                  you would like every other exon or gene to be highlighted in blue. <br># image of
                  highlighted browser here.

                       src="">
              <li>Click submit to be taken back to the Genome Browser display.
           </ul>
        <p>Exon and gene slicing is computed relative to the "most annotated" gene track for
           that assembly, and includes all exons and genes in every subtrack if the 
           gene track used is a super-track or composite track.
        
        <p># This would be a good session example once this feature comes out<br>
           One can see this on the human hg38 assembly by searching for a gene, say SOD1,
           and then turning on multi-region with exons and highlighting alternate
           regions. One will still see many intron regions in the GENCODE V22 track,
           even though multi-region slices exons based on the Gencode track.

<a name="CustomRegions"></a>	
<div class="section">
<h1>Display a Custom Region with a BED File</h1>
	<div class="sectionContent">
	<p>The Data Integrator allows you to select up to five data sources to intersect. These
	data sources can be tracks provided by UCSC or your own data uploaded using 
	<a href="../../../cgi-bin/hgCustom" target="_blank">custom tracks</a> or
	<a href="../../../cgi-bin/hgHubConnect" target="_blank">track hubs</a>. Only positional
	tables, such as BED, Wiggle, and genePred, are currently allowed in the output.
	Other formats such as MAF or BAM are currently unavailable in the Data
	Integrator.

	<p>Items in your selected tracks are output based on their overlap with items in your
	primary track. The primary track is the one that shows up first in the list of
	your chosen data sources. In the following example, UCSC Genes would be the primary
	track and items would be output based on their overlap with items in UCSC Genes:
	<p>
	<img style="border: 1px solid black; display: block;"
	src="../../images/hgIntegratorDataSourceConfig.png">
	</p>
	<p>The order of your selected tracks also affects the order of fields in your output.
	Fields from tracks that are higher up in the <b>Configure Data Sources</b> box will show
	up before tracks that are lower in that box. Using the same order of tracks seen in the
	previous example, this means that fields from the UCSC Genes track will appear first in
	the output, then fields from DNase Clusters and lastly fields from Conservation -
	100 Vert. El. However, your tracks aren't limited to the order in which you selected them,
	and you can rearrange the order of your tracks at any time. To do so, just click and drag
	a track to a new position in the list. A track can be removed by clicking the
	"<b>X</b>" next to it.

<a name="Haplotype"></a>
<div class="section">
<h1>Viewing an Alternate Haplotype Against the Reference Region</h1>
	<div class="sectionContent">
	<p>The current intersection mechanism the Data Integrator uses is fairly simple. For gene
	transcripts, mRNAs, and any other tracks where the items have blocks or gaps, the overlap
	for the entire range of the item is computed. This means that introns and gaps in the item
	are also considered when computing overlap. This is an improvement upon the Table Browser
	which only computed overlap with exons. For example, let's consider the following situation
	using the UCSC Genes and DNase Clusters tracks:
	<p>
	<img style="border: 1px solid black; display: block;"
	src="../../images/hgIntegratorHgTracksExample.png">
	<p>
	If we were using the Data Integrator to find the DNase peaks that overlapped with the
	gene in the UCSC Genes track, we would get all of the visible peaks in our output.

	<p>Additionally, items are output regardless of the amount of overlap. This means that if
	there is even a single base of overlap between two items, they are included in the output.

<a name="OutputConfig"></a>
<div class="section">
<h1>Configuring Output</h1>
	<div class="sectionContent">
        <p>By default, the Data Integrator outputs all fields of all data sources
        except for the <tt>bin</tt> column of database tables (a numerical index added by UCSC
        to speed up database queries).
	If you are only interested in the data from a limited number of fields, you can customize
	the set of fields to include in the output. After
	selecting and configuring your data sources as described in the <a href="#DataSources">
	Selecting Data Sources</a> section, click <button type="button">Choose fields...</button>
	to begin configuring your output. After clicking the button, a pop-up with all the fields
	from your selected tables will appear:
	<p>
	<img style="border: 1px solid black; display: block;"
	src="../../images/hgIntegratorFieldsConfig.png">
	<p>Uncheck the box next to the field name to exclude it from the output;
        check the box if you change your mind and want to include it.
        You can quickly select or deselect all of the fields by clicking
        <button type="button">Set all</button> or
        <button type="button">Clear all</button> below the track name.
        After you have finished selecting your
	output fields, click <button type="button">Done</button> at the bottom of the dialog
	box to finish configuring your output.
	
	<p>If you want to view your results in the web browser window, simply click
	<button type="button">Get output</button>. Or, if you want to send your output to a file, 
	check the box next to <b>Send output to file</b>. You can compress your output file using
	gzip by checking the box next to <b>Compress with gzip (.gz)</b>.  Then click
        <button type="button">Get output</button> to begin downloading your file.
	</p>
	
	<p>Note that for wiggle tracks, the "Value" field is averaged across the region of overlap.
	In the future, we intend to add an option to output all of the data values in that region
	of overlap.

	<p>
        If a single item in the primary track has multiple matches in a secondary track,
        then the Data Integrator outputs multiple rows.  Each row repeats the fields of
        the primary track item, and then adds fields of the <em>nth</em> matching item
        from each secondary track.
        If there are multiple secondary tracks, then their items will appear together in
        a row of output whether or not they overlap each other.  For example, note how items
        overlap (or not) in the three tracks A, B and C in the image below:
	<p><img style="border: 1px solid black; display: block;"
	src="../../images/hgIntegratorHgTracksExample2.png">
        <p>
        Two items from track B (B1, B2) overlap the primary item (A).
        Three items from track C (C1, C2, C3) overlap the primary item (A).
        The Data Integrator prints 3 rows of output.  B1 and C1, although they
        do not overlap, appear together in the first row of output.
        B2 and C2 appear together in the second row of output.
        The third row of output has empty fields for track B followed
        by C3's fields.  This is the output (when A, B and C are 4-field
