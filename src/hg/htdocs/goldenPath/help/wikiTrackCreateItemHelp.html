<P>
The <em>position:</em> indicated here is your current browser window
viewpoint.  You can either adjust your position here, or go back
to your browser window and find the location where you want to add
an item, then return to this entry form.
</P>
<P>
Your new entry will automatically be tagged with your wiki user name
and a date/time stamp.  You do not need to add those in the comments.
Your entered comments will be maintained by the wiki system.  After
you establish the item here, you can make more extensive edits in
the wiki system itself which has a more convenient editing interface.
</P>
<P>
If you do not care about the item name, leave it as the default
<em>defaultName</em> and a name will be assigned to your item.
</P>
<P>
At the current time, the item score is not used in any other context.
It is not important at this time.  <em>Perhaps it is unneeded for this
feature ?</em>
</P>
<P>
At the current time, the <em>classification group</em> is not used in any other
context.  Future development may determine a better classification scheme
that would be useful.
