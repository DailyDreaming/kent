This histogram shows the selected protein's molecular weight and displays it 
relative to the genome-wide statistical distribution of 5000 randomly selected SwissProt 
human proteins. The molecular weight is shown at the top of the histogram, and
the vertical dark blue bar indicates the weight relative to the genome-wide
distribution.
