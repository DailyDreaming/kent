<!------------Description---------->
This histogram shows the selected protein's molecular weight and displays it 
relative to the genome-wide statistical distribution of 5000 randomly selected SwissProt 
human proteins [FIXME - is this still true?]. The molecular weight is shown at the top of the histogram, and
a vertical dark blue bar indicates the weight relative to the genome-wide
distribution.
