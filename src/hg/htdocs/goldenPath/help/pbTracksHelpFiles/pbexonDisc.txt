The human genome sequence may be nearing completion, but there is still much 
work to be done to accurately identify all the full-length encoded proteins. 
Because of persistent homology with other species, protein-coding exons are easier to 
identify than 5' and 3' untranslated exons. Problems remain for novel genes that 
have not been studied experimentally in any species. It has also proven very difficult 
to find the proper amino terminus in gene families where this is poorly 
conserved. Predicted genes do not always have a reliable stop codon. 
<P>
Within an orthologous gene family, the exon number, exon locations, 
length, and coding phase (how a codon is split between consecutive
exons) are usually conserved from mammal to fugu, but not to nematode or fruit fly. 
Paralogous gene families do not necessarily conserve any of these attributes when gene 
duplications are very old, as is the case with the 17 members of the mammalian

TARGET=_blank>sulfatase family</A>. 
<P>
The Protein Browser provides information on these features based on NCBI's 
RefSeq track, which is a mixture of known, reviewed, and predicted genes. 
The genome-wide statistical distribution is based on the exonCount field of the 
June '02 refGene table, which contains the exon number for 15,485 genes. 
This data is somewhat distorted because a small number of alternatively 
spliced genes are counted more than once, and the first and last 
exons of many predicted genes are incomplete.
<P>
Long introns give rise to systematic errors in the tables, in that predicted genes 
are often unwittingly split into two or more pieces. This shifts the exon number 
distribution toward lower counts. In some cases, purely UTR exons are inappropriately 
included. While further work will improve and add many gene models, the overall 
affect on statistics may be slight. 
<P>
Reference mRNAs do not always align fully anywhere in the genome
for a variety of reasons. It is worth distinguishing gaps in the
genomic sequence that may disappear in later assemblies and indel 
polymorphisms in the mRNA relative to the genome. For example, genomic 
PRND is 24 bp shorter than 98% of mRNAs from random subjects. 
Blat is not reliably capable of finding short exons in long 
introns, the shortest known being a two-codon exon. These 
latter problems do not go away with finished genome, although many
short exons could be successfully force-fit by a second, tuned 
Blat pass, given the constrained target intron and phase 
consistency requirements. 
<P>
On the Proteome Browser display, the amino acid 
sequence is derived from its experimental evidence, the mRNA, 
whereas the exon track comes from the genomic alignment. When a 
piece of the mRNA can't be aligned, it is grayed out and not 
assigned an exon number. 
This results in unstable exon numbers downstream, and perhaps gives unfamiliar 
numbers to well-known exons in certain genes assigned in the experimental literature.  
However, exon numbering is dynamic, as new 5'UTR exons are often found over 
time. Numbering exons from the start codon is vulnerable to alternative translation 
starts. With alternative splicing, there may not be a consistently dominant or 
naturally canonical form in all tissues to number from. Thus, there is no consensus on 
exon numbering at this time.  
<P>
Corrections for the exon track can be made from the gap track. 
If the unalignable piece commences at a gap but re-commences 
later after good genomic sequence, the browser may treat that 
as an extension of the proximal exon but display in gray to 
indicate uncertainty through the other cases.  
<P>
If the mRNA coding has an insertional polymorphism relative to 
ungapped genomic sequence, it can be assigned to an existing 
exon based on shortness (if 1-2 residues) or by using the Simple
Repeat track (protein version). Longer insertions usually arise 
as within-exon replication slippage. Thus, these situations are 
resolvable but need to be indicated by gray in the Genome Browser. 
<P>
If the mRNA coding has a deletional polymorphism relative to genomic, that 
will also be of length 3n bp. Alignment to genomic gives rise to a spurious 
intron amounting to the looped-out DNA. Here the correction, for n &lt; 25, which 
is usually the case, is to override that intron call and merge the two affected 
exons, here using a gray bar as separator. Authenticated mammalian introns have 
a very sharp cutoff below 75 bp due to needs of the spliceosome. The exon track has 
had quality assurance based on this intron cutoff. 
<P>
It is also advisable to put some sort of cutoff on mRNA-derived protein 
length. Proteins under 100 amino acids are often fragments, mispredictions, or 
simply artifacts. To set the cut-off objectively, the length distribution plot 
was sampled for hand-curation at the low end (5 putative proteins in each block 
of ten range, e.g., 30-40 aa) to examine the evidence. The quality increases 
monotonically with greater length; the cutoff was set at 80% or greater having 
meaningful other supporting documentation. The rejects are still furnished from 
a hyperlink and can launch a custom track. 
<P>
Exon count in mammals has an early peak that declines rapidly and 
monotonically to a very long tail reaching out to

annotation bias against long proteins. 
<P>
Genes with a single coding exon appear in excess, but this is distorted by 
certain large gene families (olfactory receptors), gene fragments, and 
unrecognized processed pseudogenes (human ribosomal proteins alone have over

known pseudogenes</A>); discounting this, a single peak would occur at 4 exons 
(7.4% of all genes). There remains a substantial annotation bias toward fewer 
exons as prediction software tends to split genes possessing long introns -- the 
number of genes in the

(UCSC version hg12).

The distribution of intra-coding intron sizes is understated on the long side 
by residual sequence gaps and an annotation bias allocating them to intergenic 
regions. The cutoff on the short side reflects length requirements of the 
spliceosome.
