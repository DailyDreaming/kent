Cysteine is not a common amino acid, with an abundance of 2.3% genome-wide, 
and is most often found paired in disulfides.  Disulfides in human proteins 
are found almost exclusively in oxidative environments, such as on the cell 
surface or in lysosomes, but not in the cytoplasm or the nucleus. 
Therefore,  high cysteine content, after discounting for iron-sulfur cluster 
proteins, is contra-indicative of a cytoplasmic location.  Similarly, the 
presence of glycosylation sites, as cell-surface indicators, suggests that 
cysteines in a protein will usually be paired.
<P>
The Cysteines track shows where cysteines occur along the peptide chain,
but does not predict whether a given cysteine occurs in a disulfide or
where its partner is located. Two cysteine 
residues that are linked together to form a disulfide are not necessarily 
located near each other in the amino acid sequence.  Rather, the correct cysteine 
residues are brought into proximity during protein folding, which may bring any
two cysteine residues together. Mammals have an extensive disulfide isomerase activity 
in the endoplasmic reticulum believed to chaperon disulfides toward the 
correct pairing (and thus folding). 
<P>
Cystine-pair information is available when the 3-D structure is known, 
when the selected protein can be threaded to a known structure, or when a 
satisfactory <em>ab initio</em> model exists. SwissProt has also culled 
experimentally determined disulfides from the literature. 
<P>
Otherwise, no web tool was available for disulfide bond prediction as of 
August 2002 (however,  see 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11673241&amp;dopt=Abstract"

TARGET=_blank>2</A>). 
Note that intermolecular disulfides are fairly common, yet these are often unknown 
and so would be very difficult to take into account. Were they reliably 
predictable, disulfides would provide a strong geometrical constraint on <em>ab 
initio</em> structure prediction in applicable proteins. 
<P>
Disulfide bonds are quite well conserved evolutionarily in many protein 
families, even as the percent identity drops below 30%. Thus, conserved cysteines 
that are not part of an active site are distinguishable from sporadic cysteines and 
are likely in a disulfide. If the family is large enough and the number of cysteines 
fairly small, the pairing pattern can sometimes be inferred, starting with the 2 
best-conserved cysteines found in the deepest alignment. Other proteins, with 
complex disulfide knots, are intractable to homology methods. 
<P>
Certain protein domains have characteristic disulfides. These are often 
preserved even as the domain finds itself in a much larger protein with many 
additional cysteines. The domain tool 
<A HREF="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/search.html" TARGET=_blank>InterPro</A> 
provides 115 listings under disulfide. 
<P>
Another special case occurs in transmembrane proteins. For example, ectodomain 
cysteines will not be paired with transmembrane or endodomain cysteines. Being 
external to the cell, they are likely in disulfides although the pairing is not 
always resolved and indeed may be intermolecular.
