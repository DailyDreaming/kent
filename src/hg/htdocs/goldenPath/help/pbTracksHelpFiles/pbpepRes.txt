<!------------Description---------->
This histogram shows amino acid anomalies within the selected 
protein relative to their average occurrence genome-wide. The bars of the 
graph indicate the genome-wide average frequencies of the amino acids,
and the thin blue vertical lines indicate the abundance of the amino acids 
within the selected protein. 
Amino acids two standard deviations above or below the average are 
represented by thick red or blue lines, respectively. 
Genome-wide averages were based on amino acid data from the 
[FIXME - add table name] table. 
Standard deviations were 
derived from the compositions of 1000 [FIXME - is this still true?] 
randomly-chosen proteins. 
<P>
See the <A HREF="pbpepAnom.shtml">Amino Acid Anomalies track</A> to view 
specific occurrences of excessive or deficient amino acids within the protein 
sequence.
