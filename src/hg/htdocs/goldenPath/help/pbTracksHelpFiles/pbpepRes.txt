<!------------Description---------->
This histogram shows amino acid anomalies within the selected 
protein relative to their average occurrence genome-wide. The bars of the 
graph indicate the genome-wide average frequencies of the amino acids,
and the blue vertical lines indicate the abundance of the amino acids 
within the selected protein. 
Any amino acid with an abundance that falls outside the 2.5% to 97.5%
genome-wide distribution range is represented by a red line.
Genome-wide averages were based on amino acid data from the
knownGene table in this assembly [FIXME - is this correct?].
Standard deviations were 
derived from compositions of the genome-wide set of proteins.
<P>
See the <A HREF="pbpepAnom.shtml">Amino Acid Anomalies track</A> to view 
specific occurrences of excessive or deficient amino acids within the protein 
sequence.
