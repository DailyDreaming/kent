<!------------Description---------->
This histogram shows the mean hydrophobicity for the selected protein relative
to a genome-wide distribution of all proteins, which is essentially a 
broad Gaussian centered on zero. The mean hydrophobicity is shown at the top
of the histogram, and is indicated by a dark blue vertical line overlying the 
genome-wide distribution. 
<P>
To view the distribution of hydrophobic residues across the selected protein,
see the <A HREF="pbhydroTrack.shtml">Hydrophobicity track</A>.
