The existence of disulfide and glycosylation sites within the protein predicts 
subcellular location: cytoplasmic proteins are not 
glycosylated and only rarely have disulfides (the intracellular milieu is too 
reducing). Glycosylation affects protein folding, trafficking, solubility, 
antigenicity, half-life, localization, and cell-to-cell interactions. Disulfides 
are important to structural stability and provide the link for some oligomeric proteins. 
<P>
Potential N-glycosylation sites are somewhat reliably 
predicted by a tripeptide motif, NXT or NXS, where X is not proline and P seldom follows. 
Multiple motifs in mature regions 
of the same protein and conservation in homologs provide strong additional support. 
Glycoproteins are likely targeted to the cell exterior, lysosome or similar 
compartment, or extra-cellular space, and not to the cytoplasm, nucleus, or 
mitochondria. Predictions can sometimes be reinforced by the presence of a signal 
peptide or a glycosylphosphatidylinositol

membrane anchor</A>. 
<P>
Actual occupancy of N-glycosylation sites <em>in vivo</em> is uneven. Specific sites 
are substituted to varying degrees of saturation in tissues at 
different developmental stages, and potential carbohydrate moieties are not always 
fully built-out. The three amino acids involved are very common; therefore, many 
chance occurrences will happen. 
Taking the occurrence of the reversed motif as an estimate of the 
frequency of these motifs to be expected randomly, the number of glycosylation
sites that are used genome-wide can be estimated (see Table 1) as the number
of sites in excess of that.  However, this does not address glycosylation of specific
occurrences. Some glycosylation sites are quite ancient, but others have been 
gained or lost over moderate time scales in homologs.

<P>
The mouse/human conservation of a potential motif provides only weak support for 
its utilization. Because overall protein conservation is 85%, the 2 amino acid 
motif would be invariant 72% of the time regardless. Even observed conservation 
between pufferfish and human is not persuasive (50% chance). However, a persuasive 
case can sometimes be made by considering the multiple motifs within a single 
protein, conservation across paralogs, and ESTs from additional genomes.
