<!------------Description---------->
This track appears as two types of display. If the mRNA matches the 
forward (+) strand of the genomic sequence as displayed in the Genome Browser, 
the DNA sequence is displayed as a single row of nucleotides whose codons are
read directly into the amino acid sequence.
<P>
If the mRNA matches the reverse (-) strand of the genomic sequence,
this track shows both strands of the DNA.
The upper strand matches the mRNA, to follow the convention that a 
protein sequence is displayed in the amino-to-carboxy direction.  The 
genomic sequence as viewed in the Genome Browser, therefore, is read from 
the lower strand (labeled "&amp; Complement") in the reverse direction.
<P>
For example, the first few codons of the gene for human thymidylate kinase, 
CDC8, appear on the negative strand of chromosome 2 in the hg16 Genome Browser
as:
