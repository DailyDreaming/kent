<!------------Description---------->
This track shows the position and layout of exons within the gene and their 
correspondence to the protein's amino acid sequence. Exons are
depicted by alternating blue and green bands, and are labeled by their order
number within the gene. This blue/green coloring is repeated in the DNA 
Sequence track, which also shows the coding phase. 
In cases where exon boundaries are stair-stepped, 
the amino acid coding has been split across two exons. Whereas the amino acid 
sequence is derived from experimental mRNA evidence, the exon track comes 
from the genomic alignment. When a piece of the mRNA can't be aligned, it is grayed
out and is not assigned an exon number.
