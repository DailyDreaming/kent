<!------------Description---------->
This histogram displays the extent to which certain amino acids within the
protein sequence differ in abundance from their average occurrence
genome-wide. Amino acids present in excessive or deficient amounts are
represented by a red vertical bar extending above or below the middle line,
respectively. The height of the bar indicates the degree of departure of the
amino acid frequency from the expected value genome-wide.
<P>
The histogram is based on data from approximately 10,000 proteins [FIXME - selection
criteria?]. Amino acids are flagged as anomalous if their occurrence in a
protein is less than 5% or greater than 95% of their average abundance
genome-wide. Proteins with less than 100 amino acids have been filtered from
the sample to exclude variances attributable to short length.
<P>
See the <A HREF="pbpepRes.shtml">Amino Acid Frequencies histogram</A> to
view amino acid abundances in this assembly, based on data from the [FIXME - add
name] table.
