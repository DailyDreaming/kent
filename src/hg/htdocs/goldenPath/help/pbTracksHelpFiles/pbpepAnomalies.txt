<!------------Description---------->
This histogram displays the extent to which certain amino acids within the protein 
sequence differ in abundance from their average occurrence genome-wide. 
Amino acids present in excess are represented by a red vertical bar extending
above the middle line, and deficient residues are depicted by a blue bar extending
downward. The height of the bar indicates the degree of departure 
of the amino acid frequency from the expected value genome-wide.
<P>
See the <A HREF="pbpepRes.shtml">Amino Acid Frequencies histogram</A> to view amino 
acid abundances in the June '02 human genome assembly, based on 1,759,768 amino acids.
