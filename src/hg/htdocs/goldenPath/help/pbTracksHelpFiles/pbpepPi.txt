<!------------Description---------->
The pI (isoelectric point) histogram shows the pI of the selected protein relative 
to a genome-wide statistical distribution of pI of all proteins from SWISS-PROT 
and TrEMBL. TrEMBL-NEW proteins are not included in the distribution. The
calculated pI of the protein is displayed at the top of the histogram, and is
shown as a vertical blue line overlying the statistical distribution. 
<P>
The distribution data were generated by compiling a list of protein IDs from these two 
databases, then feeding the IDs in small numbers to the SWISS-PROT 
<A HREF="http://us.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html" TARGET=_blank>pI
calculation tool</A>. The resulting pages were parsed, and the data saved in table 
pepPiMw.
<P>
To view the polarity and relative isoelectric point of each of 
the amino acids in the protein sequence, see the <A
