Proteins are charged due to amino acid side chains, secondary modifications, and unblocked 
terminal residues. The net charge swings from negative to positive according to 
the pH of the ambient water and the local environment of each contributing 
residue in the folded protein. The pI is the pH that results in a net charge
of zero. 
<P>
The pI is a useful property because it predicts solubility properties 
and is therefore suggestive of the type of environment in which a protein 
will be found.  As a practical matter, at the isoelectric-focusing stage 
of 2-D electrophoresis, each protein migrates to its isoelectric point. A protein 
migrating anomalously may have an unsuspected covalent 
modification. Unusual values of pI can also provide clues to protein function 
and location. For example, pepsin A has a pI of 3.4, consistent with its 
expression in the highly acidic stomach; cytochrome c has a pI of 9.6 providing 
a strong positive charge at cellular pH appropriate to A protein binding
a negatively-charged membrane phospholipid. 
<P>
The Protein Browser's pI histogram display calls attention to unusual 
values of pI that could be clues to function or location. 
<P>
The pI algorithm uses pK values for relevant amino acids (C, D, E, H, K, R, 
S, T, Y, and amino- and carboxy- termini) derived experimentally for model peptides in 
9M urea at 25 degrees C, not ideal but the best available. The prediction tool 
removes predicted signal peptides, but does not consider other modifications. It 
is least accurate on small proteins with limited intrinsic buffering capacity, 
with highly basic proteins where pI lacks a solid experimental foundation, and 
on protein domains buried in membrane. Raw sequence is used when no SwissProt 
accession is available. 
<P>
Clearly, it is not feasible to precisely predict pI for native proteins
because this requires knowledge of how the local folded environment has affected 
ionization propensities (pK) of individual contributing residues, notably 
histidine, the residue most sensitive to slight variations around neutral pH. 
Furthermore, biologically relevant pI is a property of mature protein but not 
all processing steps can be reliably predicted. Modification may cycle <em>in vivo</em> 
according to regulatory status -- for example, many proteins are 
transiently phosphorylated. 
<P>
Genome-wide experimental determination of the pI of native proteins cannot be 
accomplished on a microarray because each protein would need to be correctly 
processed, folded, and modified. Some relevant modifications, such as sialylated 
glycosylation, are not yet achievable in vitro, and can vary by cell type. 
<P>
Nonetheless, the predicted pI values are accurate enough for many purposes. 
<P>
Intrinsic membrane proteins are likely under-represented in the data set
because they are more difficult to purify than peripheral or cytosolic
proteins.  Mammalian pIs seem adequately modeled by an 
acidic Gaussian centered on pH 5.8, a pronounced trough at pH 7.4, and an 
alkaline Gaussian centered on pH 8.8. The near-neutral pI region has presumably 
been depleted by selective pressure -- cytoplasmic proteins are least soluble at 
their isoelectric point. Proteins may thus be evolutionarily trapped on one peak 
or the other.
