<!------------Description---------->
This track displays amino acids within the protein sequence that differ in 
abundance from their average occurrence genome-wide. 
Amino acids present in excess are shown above the line in red, and deficient 
residues are shown below the line in blue. 
<P>
See the <A HREF="pbpepAnomalies.shtml">Amino Acid Anomalies histogram</A> to view amino 
acid abundances in this assembly, based on the [FIXME - add table name] table.
