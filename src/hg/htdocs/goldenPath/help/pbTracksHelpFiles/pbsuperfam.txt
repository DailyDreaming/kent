<!------------Description---------->
This track shows the positions and names of predicted domains within the protein, as 
determined by Hidden Markov Modeling (<A HREF="http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/sam.html" 
TARGET=_blank>HMM</A>) comparison to all known 3-D structures. Each predicted
domain is represented by a yellow box. Click on a domain to display Superfamily 
information about that domain. 
<P>
This information is 
provided by <A HREF="http://supfam.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/SUPERFAMILY/"
TARGET=_blank>SuperFamily</A>, which uses the Structural Classification of
Proteins System (<A HREF="http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/"
TARGET=_blank>SCOP</A>). 
This method has an advantage over <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/index.nojs.cgi"
TARGET=_blank>Blast or psi-Blast</A> in that protein folds are 
often conserved long after primary sequence alignment has become unreliable 
(10-25% identity range). 
<P>
Refer to the <A HREF="pbintPCnt.shtml">InterPro Domains histogram</A> to view the total number 
of predicted domains within this protein and compare this count to the number of 
multiple-domain proteins genome-wide.
