<!------------Description---------->
The Polarity track shows the polarity and isoelectric point (pI) for each of 
the amino acids in the protein sequence. Negatively-charged amino acids are
represented by red blocks below the center line, and positively-charged amino
acids are represented in blue above the center line. The height of the block
gives some indication of the pI of the amino acid relative to others.
<P>
See the <A HREF="pbpepPi.shtml">pI histogram</A> to view the pI of the selected protein 
relative to a genome-wide statistical distribution of pI of all proteins from 
SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL.
