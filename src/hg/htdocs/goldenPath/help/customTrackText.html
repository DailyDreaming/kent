<P>
The Genome Browser provides dozens of aligned annotation tracks that have been
computed at UCSC or have been provided by outside collaborators. In addition to 
these standard tracks, it is also possible for users to upload their own 
annotation data for temporary display in the browser. These custom annotation 
tracks are viewable only on the machine from which they were uploaded and are 
automatically discarded 24 hours after the last time they are accessed. 
Optionally, users can make custom annotations viewable by others as well.
<P>
Custom tracks are a wonderful tool for research scientists using the Genome 
Browser. Because space is limited in the Genome Browser track window, many 
excellent genome-wide tracks cannot be included in the standard set of tracks 
packaged with the browser.
Other tracks of interest may be excluded from distribution because the 
annotation track data is too specific to be of general interest or can't be 
shared until journal publication. Many individuals and labs have contributed
custom tracks to the Genome Browser website for use by others. To view a list 
of these custom annotation tracks, click the 
<A HREF="/goldenPath/customTracks/custTracks.html">Custom Tracks</A> link on 
the Genome Browser home page.
<P>
Custom annotation tracks are similar to standard tracks, but never become part 
of the MySQL genome database. Each track has its own controller and persists 
even when not displayed in the Genome Browser window, e.g. if the position 
changes to a range that no longer includes the track. Typically, custom 
annotation tracks are aligned under corresponding genomic sequence, but they 
can also be completely unrelated to the data. For example, a track can be 
displayed under a long sequence consisting of millions of <em>N</em>s.
<P>
Genome Browser annotation tracks are based on files in line-oriented format. 
Each line in the file defines a display characteristic for the track or defines 
a data item within the track. 
Annotation files contain three types of lines: browser lines, track lines, 
and data lines. Empty lines and those starting with &quot;#&quot; are ignored. 

<P>To construct an annotation file and display it in the Genome 
Browser, follow these steps:

<A NAME="format"></A>
<P><B>Step 1. Format the data set</B><BR>
Formulate your data set as a tab-separated file using one of the formats 
supported by the Genome Browser. Annotation data can be in 
standard <A HREF="#GFF">GFF</A> format or in a format designed specifically 
for the Human Genome Project or UCSC Genome Browser, including 
<A HREF="#GTF">GTF</A>, <A HREF="#PSL">PSL</A>, <A HREF="#BED">BED</A>, 
or <A HREF="wiggle.html">WIG</A>. 
GFF and GTF files <I>must</I> be tab-delimited rather than
space-delimited to display correctly. You may include more than one data
set in your annotation file; these need not be in the same
format.

<P><B>Step 2. Define the Genome Browser display characteristics</B><BR>
Add one or more optional <A HREF="#BROWSER">browser lines</A> to the 
beginning of your formatted data file to configure the overall 
display of the Genome Browser when it initially displays your annotation 
data. Browser lines allow you to configure such things 
as the genome position that the Genome Browser will initially open to, 
the width of the display, and the configuration of the other
annotation tracks that are shown (or hidden) in the initial display. 
NOTE: If the browser position is not explicitly set in the annotation 
file, the initial display will default to the position setting most 
recently used by the user, which may not be an
appropriate position for viewing the annotation track.

<P><B>Step 3. Define the annotation track display characteristics</B><BR>
Following the browser lines - and immediately preceding the formatted 
data - add a <A HREF="#TRACK">track line</A> to 
define the display attributes for your annotation data set. Track lines 
enable you to define annotation track characteristics 
such as the name, description, colors, initial display mode, use score,
etc. If you have included more than one data set in your annotation
file, insert a track line at the beginning of each new set of data.

TARGET=_blank>here</A> to view this track in the Genome Browser.

<P><B>Step 4. View your annotation track in the Genome Browser</B><BR>
To view your annotation data in the Genome Browser, open the 
Genome Browser home page <A HREF="../../index.html"
TARGET=_blank>(http://genome.ucsc.edu/)</a> and click the Genome 
Browser link in the top menu bar. On the Genome Browser Gateway page that
displays, select the genome and assembly on which your annotation data is based,
then click the &quot;add custom tracks&quot; button. 
<P>
The Add Custom Tracks page contains two large text boxes: a data text box for 
loading annotation data and a documentation text box for loading an optional 
track description text file.
The annotation data may be loaded in one of three ways:
<UL>
<LI>
Enter one or more URL for custom tracks (one per line) in the data text box. The
Genome Browser supports both the HTTP and FTP (passive-only) protocols.
<LI>
Click the &quot;Browse&quot; button directly above the data text box, then 
choose a custom track file from your local computer, or type the pathname of the
file into the &quot;upload&quot; text box adjacent to the &quot;Browse&quot;
button. The custom track data may be compressed by any of the following 
programs: gzip (<em>.gz</em>), compress (<em>.Z</em>), or bzip2 (<em>.bz2</em>).
Files containing compressed data must include the appropriate suffix in their 
names.
<LI>
Paste or type the custom track data directly into the data box. Because the text
in this box will not be saved to a file, this method is not recommended unless
you have a copy of the data elsewhere.
</UL>
<P>
Optionally, you can submit text (in plain or HTML format) to accompany your 
custom track. This text will be displayed when a user clicks the track 
description button on the Genome Browser annotation tracks page. Descriptive 
text may be loaded by one of the following methods:
<UL>
<LI>
Click the &quot;Browse&quot; button directly above the documentation text box, 
then choose a text file from your local computer, or type the pathname of the
file into the &quot;upload&quot; text box adjacent to the &quot;Browse&quot;
button.
<LI>
If your descriptive text is located on a website, you can include a reference 
to it in your custom track description. Add an htmlUrl attribute to the 
track line of your custom track: <B>htmlUrl=<<I>external_url</I>></B>. 
In this case, there is no need to insert anything into the documentation text 
box.
<LI>
Paste or type the custom track data directly into the data box. Note that the 
text in this box will not be saved to a file; therefore, this method is 
not recommended except for temporary documentation purposes.
</UL>
<P>
To format your description page in a style that is consistent with standard
Genome Browser tracks, click the template link below the documentation text
box for an HTML template that may be copied and pasted into a file for editing.
<P>
Click the <em>Submit</em> button to
display the Genome Browser track window with your annotation. 
<!-- If you
encounter difficulties displaying your annotation, read the section 
<A HREF="#TROUBLE">Troubleshooting Annotation Display Problems</A>.
-->
</P> 
<P>
To upload a custom annotation track from another machine or web 
site, paste the URL of the track into the large edit box. Custom tracks can 
be displayed in conjunction with ordinary BLAT tracks.</P>
<P>
If you wish to display more than one custom track at a time in the Genome
Browser, load the tracks simultaneously using one of the following methods:
<UL>
<LI>
Put all the tracks into the same file (rather than separate files), then
load the file using the above steps.
<LI>
Place your track files in a web-accessible location on your server, then 
load them into the Genome Browser via their URLs as described above.
</UL></P>
<P><B>Step 5. (Optional) Add details pages for individual track features</B><BR>
After you've constructed your track and have successfully displayed it in the
Genome Browser, you may wish to customize the details pages for individual track
features.  The Genome Browser automatically creates a default details page for 
each feature in the track containing the feature's name, position information,
and a link to the corresponding DNA sequence. To view the details page for a
feature in your custom annotation track (in full, pack, or squish display
mode), click on the item's label in the annotation track window. 
<P>
You can add a link from a details page to an external web page containing
additional information about the feature by using the track line <I>url</I> attribute. 
In the annotation file, set the <I>url</I> attribute in the track line to point
to a publicly available page on a web server. The <I>url</I> attribute 
substitutes each occurrence of '$$' in the URL string with the name defined by the 
<I>name</I> attribute. You can take advantage of this feature to provide 
individualized information for each feature in your track by creating HTML anchors 
that correspond to the feature names in your web page.

<P><B><I>Example 4:</I></B><BR>
Here is an example of a file in which the <I>url</I> attribute has been set to
point to the file <A HREF="clones.html"
TARGET=_blank>http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/clones.html</A>. The '#$$'
appended to the end of the file name in the example points to the HTML NAME tag 
within the file that matches the name of the feature (cloneA, cloneB, etc.). 
NOTE: The track line in this example has been split over 2 lines for 
documentation purposes. If you paste this example into
the browser, you must remove the line break to display the track successfully.
Click <A HREF ="ct_example4.txt" TARGET=_blank>here</A> for a copy of this 
example that can be pasted into the browser without editing.

<P><B>Step 6. (Optional) Share your annotation track with others</B><BR>
The previous steps showed you how to upload annotation data for your own use 
on your own machine. However, many users would like to 
share their annotation data with members of their research group on 
different machines or with colleagues at other sites. To learn how 
to make your Genome Browser annotation track viewable by others, read 
the section <A HREF="#SHARE">Sharing Your Annotation Track with
Others</A>.</P>

          <LI>The <B>lower</B> or <EM>track description</EM> section is used to provide 
description page information in html or plain text, which is 
displayed whenever a user clicks on the custom track in the Genome Browser 
view. Html can be used for formatting purposes (and will be parsed as HTML), 
but plain text is also accepted. Input is via the same three routes as the 
data input above.
         </UL>
         <P>The Add Custom Tracks page also provides links to examples
for both data and description input types.

         <P><BR><B>Manage Custom Tracks</B>
         <P>This page becomes available after a custom track has
been loaded, either via the Add Custom Tracks page or via the 
Table Browser.  From this page, custom tracks can be added or existing
tracks deleted or modified.  Existing custom tracks are listed in a 
table with the following fields:
        <UL>
         <LI>The <B>Names</B> of the tracks are listed as links to an
update page which allows the user to replace the data in either the
data or description areas, similar to the Add Custom Tracks page.
         <LI>The <B>Description</B> field is supplied by the user in
the input file via the &quot;description&quot; attribute. If no description is
included in the input file, this field contains the track name.
         <LI>The track <B>Type</B> is determined by the Browser
depending on the format of the data.
         <LI>The <B>Doc</B> column displays a &quot;Y&quot; for &quot;Yes&quot; 
if the track has been supplied a description page.  It is empty if there is no 
track description associated with the track.
         <LI>The <B>Items</B> column shows the number of data lines
in the file (unless the data are in wiggle format).
         <LI>The <B>Pos</B> column shows the chromosome of the default
position provided by the user in the data file using the position 
attribute (unless the data are in wiggle format).  Clicking this 
link takes the user to the Genome Browser at 
the specified position (note:  Only the chromosome name is shown in the
Pos column).  If there is no default position, this column shows the chromosome
of the first data line.

        Tracks page, or from the custom track details page in the Browser.
        This page is very similar to the Add Custom Tracks page.</P>

        <P>On this page, you can update the data and/or the description for 
the custom track you clicked on to reach this page.  The data will not show up

enter the track data incorrectly, you will see an error message and the
first 50 lines of your data will be presented to you in the data box for
correction.</P>

        <P>If you originally created your custom track by uploading data or description

<P>Track lines define the display attributes for all lines in an
annotation data set. If more than one data set is included in the
annotation file, each group of data must be preceded by a track line
that describes the display characteristics for that set of data.
A track line begins with the word <tt>track</tt>, followed by one or
more <tt>attribute=value</tt> pairs.  Unlike browser lines - in which each
attribute is defined on a separate line - all of the track attributes for a
given set of data are listed on one line <I>with no line
breaks</I>. The inadvertent insertion of a line break into a track line
will generate an error when you attempt to upload the annotation track
into the Genome Browser.

<P>The following track line attribute=value pairs are defined in the
Genome Browser:</P>

<UL>
	<LI><B>name=<<I>track_label</I>></B> - Defines the track label
	that will be displayed to the left of the track in the Genome
	Browser window, and also the label of the track control at the
	bottom of the screen. The name can consist of up to 15
	characters, and must be enclosed in quotes if the text contains
	spaces. The default value is &quot;User Track&quot;.
	<LI><B>description=<<I>center_label</I>></B> - Defines the center label of the track
	in the Genome Browser window. The description can consist of up
	to 60 characters, and must be enclosed in quotes if the text contains
	spaces. The default
	value is &quot;User Supplied Track&quot;.
	<LI><B>visibility=<<I>display_mode</I>></B> - Defines the
	initial display mode of the annotation track. Values for
	<I>display_mode</I> include: 0 - hide, 1 - dense, 2 - full, 3 - pack, 
	and 4 - squish. The numerical values or the words can be used, i.e. 
	full mode may be specified by &quot;2&quot; or &quot;full&quot;. The 
	default is &quot;1&quot;.
	<LI><B>color=<<I>RRR,GGG,BBB</I>></B> - Defines the main color
	for the annotation track.  The track color consists of three comma-separated
	RGB values from 0-255.  The default value is 0,0,0 (black).

	<LI><B>itemRgb=On</B> - If this attribute is present and is set to 
	&quot;On&quot;, the Genome Browser will use the RGB value shown in
	the <em>itemRgb</em> field in each data line of 
	the associated BED track to determine the display color of the data on
	that line. NOTE: At the present time, this option is functional only
	on BED tracks with 9 or less fields.
<!--
	<LI><B>altColor=<<I>RRR,GGG,BBB</I>></B> - Defines the
	secondary color for the track.  The alternate color consists of
	three comma-separated RGB values from 0-255. The default is a
	lighter shade of whatever the <I>color</I> attribute is set to.
-->
	<LI><B>useScore=<<I>use_score</I>></B> - If this attribute is
	present and is set to 1, the <I>score</I> field in each of the track's data 
	lines will be used to determine the level of shading in which 
	the data is displayed. The track will display in shades of gray unless
	the <I>color</I> attribute is set to 100,50,0 (shades of brown) or
	0,60,120 (shades of blue). The default setting for <I>useScore</I> is &quot;0&quot;.
	<LI><B>group=<<I>group</I>></B> - Defines the annotation track group
	in which the custom track will display in the Genome Browser window.
	By default, <em>group</em> is set to &quot;user&quot;, which causes
	custom tracks to display at the top of the window.
	<LI><B>priority=<<I>priority</I>></B> - When the <em>group</em>
	attribute is set, defines the display position of the track relative 
	to other tracks within the same group in the Genome Browser window. 
	If <em>group</em> is not set, the <em>priority</em> attribute defines
	the track's order relative to other custom tracks displayed in the 
	default group, &quot;user&quot;.
	<LI><B>offset=<<I>offset</I>></B> - Defines a number to be added
	to all coordinates in the annotation track. The default is &quot;0&quot;.
	<LI><B>url=<<I>external_url</I>></B> - Defines a URL for an
	external link associated with this track. This URL will be used
	in the details page for the track. Any '$$' in this string this will be substituted
	with the item name. There is no default for this attribute.
	<LI><B>htmlUrl=<<I>external_url</I>></B> - Defines a URL for an HTML
	description page to be displayed with this track. 
	There is no default for this attribute.  A template for a standard

<P>BED format provides a flexible way to define the data lines that
are displayed in an annotation track. BED lines have three required fields and 
nine additional optional fields. The number of fields per line must be consistent
throughout any single set of data in an annotation track.  

<P>The first three required BED fields are:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><B>chrom</B> - The name of the chromosome (e.g. chr3, chrY,
	chr2_random) or scaffold (e.g. scaffold10671).
	<LI><B>chromStart</B> - The starting position of the feature in the
	chromosome or scaffold. The first base in a chromosome is numbered 0.
	<LI><B>chromEnd</B> - The ending position of the feature in the
	chromosome or scaffold. The <I>chromEnd</I> base is not included in the
	display of the feature. For example, the first 100 bases of a
	chromosome are defined as <I>chromStart=0, chromEnd=100</I>, and span
	the bases numbered 0-99.
</OL>

<P>The 9 additional optional BED fields are:</P>
<OL START=4>
	<LI><B>name</B> - Defines the name of the BED line.  This label is
	displayed to the left of the BED line in the Genome Browser
	window when the track is open to full display mode or directly to the
	left of the item in pack mode. 
	<LI><B>score</B> - A score between 0 and 1000. If the track line 
	<I>useScore</I> attribute is set to 1 for this annotation data set, the
	<I>score</I> value will determine the level of gray in which
	this feature is displayed (higher numbers = darker gray).
	<LI><B>strand</B> - Defines the strand - either '+' or '-'.
	<LI><B>thickStart</B> - The starting position at which the feature
	is drawn thickly (for example, the start codon in gene
	displays).
	<LI><B>thickEnd</B> - The ending position at which the feature is
	drawn thickly (for example, the stop codon in gene displays).
	<LI><B>itemRgb</B> - An RGB value of the form R,G,B (e.g. 255,0,0).
	If the track line <em>itemRgb</em> attribute is set to &quot;On&quot;,
	this RBG value will determine the display color of the data contained
	in this BED line. NOTE: It is recommended that a simple color scheme 
	(eight colors or less) be used with this attribute to avoid overwhelming
	the color resources of the Genome Browser and your Internet browser. 
	At the present time, this option is functional only
	on BED tracks with 9 or less fields.
	<LI><B>blockCount</B> - The number of blocks (exons) in the
	BED line.
	<LI><B>blockSizes</B> - A comma-separated list of the block
	sizes. The number of items in this list should correspond to
	<I>blockCount</I>.
	<LI><B>blockStarts</B> - A comma-separated list of block starts.
	All of the <I>blockStart</I> positions should be calculated relative to
	<I>chromStart</I>. The number of items in
	this list should correspond to <I>blockCount</I>.
</OL>

<P>
See <em>Example 3</em> for a demonstration of a custom track that uses a 
complete BED12 definition.</P>

<P><B><I>Example 5:</I></B><BR>
This example shows an annotation track that uses the itemRgb attribute to 
individually color each data line. In this track, the color scheme distinguishes
between items named &quot;Pos*&quot; and those named &quot;Neg*&quot;. See the 
usage note in the <em>itemRgb</em> description above for color palette 
restrictions.

<P>Be aware that the coordinates for a negative strand in a PSL 
line are handled in a special way. In the 
<I>qStart</I> and <I>qEnd</I> fields, the coordinates indicate 
the position where the query matches from 
the point of view of the forward strand, even when the match is on the reverse strand.
However, in the <I>qStarts</I> list, the coordinates are reversed.</P>

<P>GFF (General Feature Format) lines are based on the GFF standard file format.  GFF 
lines have nine required fields that <I>must</I> be tab-separated. If the fields are 
separated by spaces instead of tabs, the track will not display correctly. For more
information on GFF format, refer to <A
HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/formats/GFF"
TARGET=_blank>http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/formats/GFF</A>. </P>  
<P>
Here is a brief description of the GFF fields:</P>

<OL>
	<LI><B>seqname</B> - The name of the sequence.  Must be a chromosome or scaffold.
	<LI><B>source</B> - The program that generated this feature.
	<LI><B>feature</B> - The name of this type of feature. Some examples of
	standard feature types are "CDS", "start_codon", "stop_codon", and
	"exon".  
	<LI><B>start</B> - The starting position of the feature in the sequence.  
	The first base is numbered 1.
	<LI><B>end</B> - The ending position of the feature (inclusive).
	<LI><B>score</B> - A score between 0 and 1000. If the track line 
	<I>useScore</I> attribute is set to 1 for this annotation data set, the
	<I>score</I> value will determine the level of gray in which
	this feature is displayed (higher numbers = darker gray). If there is no
	score value, enter ".".
	<LI><B>strand</B> - Valid entries include '+', '-', or '.' (for don't know/don't care).
	<LI><B>frame</B> - If the feature is a coding exon, <I>frame</I> should 
	be a number between 0-2 that represents the reading frame of the
	first base.  If the feature is not a coding exon, the value should be '.'.
	<LI><B>group</B> - All lines with the same group are linked together into a single item.

<P>GTF (Gene Transfer Format) is a refinement to GFF that tightens the specification.  
The first eight GTF fields are the same as GFF. The <I>group</I> field has been 
expanded into an <I>attribute</I> field that includes a list of
semicolon-separated attribute/value pairs. For more information on this format,
see <A HREF="http://genes.cs.wustl.edu/GTF2.html" 
TARGET=_blank>http://genes.cs.wustl.edu/GTF2.html</A>.

<P>Some examples of entries for the <I>attribute</I> field include:
<UL>
<LI><B>gene_id <I>value</I></B> - A globally unique identifier for the genomic
source of the sequence.
<LI><B>transcript_id <I>value</I></B> - A globally unique identifier for the
predicted transcript.
</UL>
<P><B><I>Example 9:</I></B><BR>

<tt>gene_id Em:U62317.C22.6.mRNA; transcript_id Em:U62317.C22.6.mRNA;
exon_number 1</tt>

<P>The Genome Browser groups together GTF lines that have the same
<I>transcript_id</I> value.  It only looks at <I>EXON</I> and <I>CDS</I>
type features.</P>

To make your Genome Browser annotation track viewable by people on 
other machines or at other sites, follow the steps below. (Note that 
some of the URL examples in this section have been broken up into 2
lines for documentation display purposes).<BR><BR>

<P><B>Step 1.</B>
Put your formatted annotation file on your web site. Be sure that 
the file permissions allow it to be read by others.</P>

<P><B>Step 2.</B>
Construct a URL that will link this annotation file to the Genome 
Browser. The URL must contain 3 pieces of information specific
to your annotation data: 
<UL>
<LI>The species or genome assembly on which your annotation data is based. 
To automatically display the most recent assembly for a given organism, set 
the <em>org</em> parameter: <em>e.g.</em> <tt>org=human</tt>. To specify a 
particular genome assembly for an organism, use the <em>db</em> parameter, 
<tt>db=database_name</tt>, where <I>database_name</I> is to the UCSC code for 
the genome assembly. For a list of these codes, see the Genome Browser <A
HREF="/FAQ/FAQreleases#release1" TARGET=_blank>FAQ</A>.
Examples of this include: db=hg16 (Human July 2003 assembly), db=mm6 
(Mouse Mar. 2005 assembly). 
<LI>The genome position to which the Genome Browser should initially 
open. This information is of the form
<tt>position=chr_position</tt>, where <I>chr_position</I> is a 
chromosome number, with or without a set of 
coordinates. Examples of this include: position=chr22, position=chr22:15916196-31832390.
<LI>The URL of the annotation file on your web site. This information is
of the form <tt>hgt.customText=URL</tt>, where
<I>URL</I> points to the annotation file on your website. An example of an
annotation file URL is <font color="000099"><A HREF="test.bed"
TARGET=_blank>http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/test.bed</A></font>.  
</UL>

<P>Combine the above pieces of information into a URL of the following
format (the information specific to your annotation file is highlighted):
<BR><BR>
<tt>http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?org=<font color="000099"><I>organism_name</I></font>&amp;<BR>position=<font
color="000099"><I>chr_position</I></font>&amp;hgt.customText=<font color="000099"><I>URL</I></font></tt>.

<P><B><I>Example 10:</I></B><BR>
The following URL will open up the Genome Browser 
window to display chr 22 of the latest human genome assembly
and will show the annotation track pointed to by the URL
http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/test.bed:<BR><BR>

<font color="000099"><A HREF="../../cgi-bin/hgTracks?org=human&amp;position=chr22&amp;hgt.customText=http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/test.bed"
TARGET=_BLANK><tt>http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?org=human&amp;position=chr22&amp;<br>hgt.customText=http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/test.bed</tt></A></font><BR><BR>

<P><B>Step 3.</B> Provide the URL to others. To upload a custom annotation
<B><I>Solution:</I></B> Check that none of the browser lines, track lines, or data 
lines in your annotation file contains a line break. If the example contains GFF
or GTF data lines, check that all the fields are tab-separated rather than
space-separated.

<P><B><I>Problem:</I></B> When I click the <em>submit</em> button, I get 
the error message &quot;line 1 of custom input:&quot;.<BR>
<B><I>Solution:</I></B> Check that none of the browser lines, 
track lines, or data lines in your annotation file contains a line break. A 
common source for this problem is the track line: all of the attribute
pairs must on the same line and must not be separated by
a line break. If you are uploading your annotation file by pasting it
into the text box on the Genome Browser Gateway page, check that the cut and paste operation
did not inadvertently insert unwanted line feeds into the longer lines.

<P><B><I>Problem:</I></B> When I click the <em>submit</em> button, I get the
error message &quot;line # of custom input: missing = in var/val pair&quot;.<BR>
<B><I>Solution:</I></B> Check for incorrect syntax in the track 
lines in the annotation file. Be sure that each track line
attribute pair consists of the format <I>attribute=attribute name</I>.

<P><B><I>Problem:</I></B> When I click the <em>submit</em> button, I get the
error message &quot;line # of custom input: BED chromStarts[i] must be in ascending order&quot;.<BR>
<B><I>Solution:</I></B> This is most likely caused by a logical conflict in the 
Genome Browse software. It accepts custom GFF tracks that have multiple &quot;exons&quot; at
the same position, but not BED tracks. Because the browser translates GFF tracks 
to BED format before storing the custom track data, GFF tracks with multiple 
exons will case an error when the BED is read back in. To work around this 
problem, remove duplicate lines in the GFF track. 

<P><B><I>Problem:</I></B> When I click the <em>submit</em> button, the Genome Browser
track window displays OK, but my track isn't visible.<BR>
<B><I>Solution:</I></B> Check the browser and track lines in your annotation
file to make sure that you haven't accidentally set
the display mode for the track to <I>hide</I>. If you are using the
Annotation File box on the Genome Browser Gateway page to 
upload the track, check that you've
entered the correct file name. If neither of these is the cause 
of the problem, try resetting the Genome Browser to clear any 
settings that may be preventing the annotation to display. To 
reset the Genome Browser, click the <em>Click here to reset</em> link on the 
Gateway page. If the annotation track still doesn't display, you may 
need to clear the cookies in your Internet browser as well
(refer to your Internet browser's documentation for further information).

<P><B><I>Problem:</I></B> I've gotten my annotation track to display, 
but now I can't make it go away! How do I remove an annotation
track from my Genome Browser display?<BR>
<B><I>Solution:</I></B> Reset the Genome Browser by clicking the 
<em>default tracks</em> button on the Genome Browser tracks window or 
<em>Click here to reset</em> link on the Gateway page. This should reset 
your Genome Browser display to its default settings.
