<H1>User Guide for Cytogenetic Map Comparison</H1>
<P>We give one plot for each chromosome that shows the data from the <A
HREF="http://fishfarm.fhcrc.org/bacresource/index.shtml">resource of
FISH-mapped BAC clones</A> (<A
HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/cyto/">NCBI Clone Registry</A>) placed on the working draft. These plots are
at a fixed scale, so you will have to scroll right to cover the larger
chromosomes. Another set of plots covers the genome in fixed scale 50mb
windows, and a third set of plots covers the genome in 10mb windows.

<P>The position along the working draft sequence for the chromosome is
plotted along the horizontal axis. Each cytogenetic band is allocated a height on
the vertical axis, using the standard fractional lengths of the bands. A
horizonal line is drawn across the plot at the height corresponding to
the start position of each major band. The predicted location of every
sub-band is shown by a light blue horizontal line segment that is
located at the height corresponding to the midpoint of that sub-band,
and positioned so that it begins at the horizontal coordinate predicted to be the
beginning of the sub-band in the working draft sequence, and ends at the horizontal
coordinate predicted to be the end of that sub-band in the working draft
sequence.
These predictions are calculated by a dynamic programming method
described in "<A
HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mapPlots/cytoprogram.html">A
Dynamic Programming Method to Locate Cytogenetic Bands on the Working
Draft Sequence</A>," and will be described more fully elsewhere.

<P>Each FISH-mapped clone is displayed as a point with error bars. The
position of the point along the working draft sequence was determined by
Wonhee Jang using information about the clone, including STSs and BAC
ends. The vertical position of the point is the midpoint in the range of
possible bands predicted for the clone by FISH. The error bars indicate
the range of uncertainty for the band location for the clone. The point
is color-coded according to the lab that FISH-mapped the clone; see the key
in upper right corner of the plot.
Some clone markers are FISH-mapped to different chromosomes entirely.
These are shown at the bottom of the display.

<H2>Caveats:</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>The cytogenetic band assignments by FISH have limited
	accuracy, for more details see 
	"<A HREF="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6822/full/409953a0_fs.html">Integration of cytogenetic landmarks
	into the draft sequence of the human genome</A>," by the BAC
	Resource Consortium, <i>Nature</i>, Vol. 409.
	<LI>The predictions of band positions by dynamic programming are
	subject to errors due to inaccuracies in the FISH data. They
	also rely weakly on approximations of the band sizes given by standard
	fractional band lengths, these can be very inaccurate and can
	vary between individuals, especially in the centromeric and
	telomeric regions.
