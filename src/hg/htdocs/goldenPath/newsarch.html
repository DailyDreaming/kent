	We've experienced some RepeatMasker problems on Build 30 and are
	rerunning it. This will directly affect the RepeatMasker track and the
	masking of the fasta files. The Fish Blat and Genscan tracks may also
	change slightly once we're redone this. The EST, mRNA, and RefSeq tracks
	should not be affected. We will also post a new RepeatMasker track for
	Build 29 (see news item below) as soon as the Build 30 tracks are
	completed. We apologize for any rework this may cause.

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#006666">Posted on July 9, 2002</FONT>
	<P>
	We've found some problems with the repeat-masking of the Build 29 (hg11)
	human sequence. We're in the process of replacing the RepeatMasker
	track, but do not plan to redo the other tracks due to the imminent
	release of Build 30. Because of this, we advise that you do not use the
	cross-species tracks for statistical purposes.

	The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics home page is sporting an updated interface to 
	accommodate the growing number of organisms supported by the UCSC Genome 
	Browser, BLAT, and Table Browser. The list of assembly versions accessible 
	through each of these tools can now be found on the tool's Gateway page. To 
	reach the Gateway page, choose an organism from the dropdown list on the left 
	sidebar of this page, then click the Browser, BLAT, or Tables link. New 
	organisms will be added to the list in the months ahead.

	<P>The UCSC site continues to provide a variety of bulk downloads of a genome 
	assemblies and annotations. The list of downloadable data has been removed 
	from the home page, but is readily available through the Downloads link on 
	the left sidebar.  The downloads list can also be accessed directly at 
	<A HREF="downloads.html">http://genome.ucsc.edu/downloads.html</A> or through 
	our ftp site at 
	<A HREF="ftp://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/" TARGET=_blank>ftp://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/</A>.

	<P>Several new annotation tracks have been added to our site in the past 
	couple weeks.  The Feb. 2002 mouse assembly now has tracks for BAC End pairs, 
	Fgenesh++ gene predictions, and AltGenie gene predictions based on Affymetrix's 
	Genie gene-finding software. New to the Apr. 2002 human assembly is the 
	GenMapDB Clones track, which shows placements of BAC clones from the GenMapDB 
	database based on BAC end sequencing information and confirmed using STS 
	markers by Vivian Cheung's lab at U. Penn.  We've also changed the Known Genes 
	track name to RefSeq Genes in all assemblies.

	<P>This release also includes an updated

	<P>
	We've just released a browser and BLAT server on 
	the latest Build 29 human genome assembly from NCBI (UCSC 
	version hg11). This assembly is based 
	on sequence information submitted into GenBank as of Apr. 5 2002. As with the 
	Dec. 2001 (hg10) release, this assembly was produced at 
	NCBI rather than at UCSC.  Consult NCBI's 
	<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/release_notes.html"
	TARGET=_blank>Build 29 release notes</A> and 
	<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/HsStats.html"
	TARGET=_blank>statistics</A> for more information about this release.
	This assembly contains nearly 75% finished sequence. 
	Currently, the human genome project appears to be on track to achieve the goal 
	of finishing at least 95% of the human genome (using Bermuda standards) by April 2003.
	
	<P>Although the NCBI human genome assembly has been steadily
	improving over the past year, mapping problems still exist in
	the current release. Most are small, relatively local rearrangements. 
	Larger scale problems include a rearrangement in the p-arm of Chr16 and
	several discrepancies in Chr17.  Researchers - especially positional 
	cloners - are strongly encouraged to use the tools provided 
	(<A HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mapPlots/"
	TARGET=_blank>comparison plots</A>, <A
	HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/chromReports/"
	TARGET=_blank>chromosome reports</A>) to evaluate the
	accuracy of the assembly in specific regions of interest.

	<P>Bulk downloads of the hg11 data should be available from this site
	in approximately one week. New annotation tracks will be posted as soon
	as they become available.

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#006666">Posted on Feb 16, 2002</FONT>
	<P>A new assembly based on sequence submitted as of Dec. 22 in Genbank (Build 28) is
	now available in the browser and for BLAT search.  
	This assembly was produced at NCBI rather than UCSC, primarily by
	Richa Agarwala, Greg Schuler, and Paul Kitts.  The NCBI assembly has
	been steadily improving over the past year.  Currently it shows slightly
	better local order and orientation compared to the UCSC assembly on the
	same sequence, but somewhat worse tracking of the chromosome level maps.
	The NCBI assembly has the advantage that it can be generated significantly
	faster than the UCSC assembly.  With the human genome sequencing now
	in the end game - over two thirds of the human clones are now finished -
	we feel it more productive to focus worldwide annotation efforts on a
	single assembly rather than continue producing competing assemblies.
	We're working with NCBI to improve their map tracking. <br></P>

        <P>There are some major enhancements to the browser. The complete user interface settings
		including track controls, labels, and position are now saved from session to session.
		You can configure the browser once to your liking and it will stay that way. This feature
		will only work if cookies are enabled in your browser. If you
		want to restore the default settings use the reset all button under the main graphic.
		Also under the main graphic are new controls that move just the start or just the end
		of the genome window. These are useful for getting exactly the right view without having
		to do arithmetic on the position.  These controls by default will move two guideline units
		at a time, but you can specify other increments.  There's a new page associated with each
		track. This page is accessible by clicking on the mini-buttons to the left of the track 
		in the main graphic, or by clicking on the new hyperlink associated with the track in the
		track controls section under the graphic.  These pages contain a description of the track
		and in many cases new controls.  The mRNA and EST associated controls let you color or
		filter the display according to tissue, author, organism, and so forth.</P>
		<P>As with any new enhancement there are likely to be a few new bugs too.
		Many of these have been spotted and fixed already.  Please let us know (genome@cse.ucsc.edu) 
		if you find a problem that persists more than a day or two.  It's always helpful to include 
		the freeze and genomic position with a problem report.<br></P>

<hr>	
<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#006666">Posted on Nov. 8, 2001</FONT>
        <P>A new FISH Clones track has been added to the April and August browsers.
        Previously, this information has been included in the STS Markers track.
        Now, this has been broken out into a separate track with additional
        information provided on the detail page not previously shown.<br></P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#006666">Posted on Oct 27, 2001</FONT>
        <P>You can now share your custom tracks with the
        community. The easiest way to do this is to construct a link from your own
        web pages to the browser.  Here is an example of a URL for
        such a link:
        <pre>   http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?
        position=chr22:1-20000&db=hg8&
        hgt.customText=http://genome-test.cse.ucsc.edu/test.bed</pre>

        The position variable tells the browser which part of the genome to
        display.  The db variable refers to the freeze number.
        'hg8' corresponds to the August 2001 freeze.  The customText
        variable should refer to a URL containing plain text in one of the
        formats described in <a href="/goldenPath/help/customTrack.html">
        http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/customTrack.html</a>.
        <br><br>
        Note that generally we only keep the last three versions of the
        genome online (hg6, hg7, and hg8).  You'll have to update
        your link and track about every 4 months as a result.
        <br><br>
        Please send in the URLs of tracks you'd like to share to
        <a href="mailto:genome@cse.ucsc.edu"> genome@cse.ucsc.edu</a>,
        along with a brief description of
        the track and the genome version it is tied to.  We'll create
        an index page of these here.
    <br><br>
        You can also access an external custom track by including
        the URL of the track data (on a separate line starting with
        http://) in the custom track box at the bottom of the browser gateway.</P>

	us know at genome@cse.ucsc.edu. Though the state of the working
	draft has improved considerably, remember that where you see 
	solid marks in the 'gap' track, the relative order and 
	orientation of flanking contigs is still uncertain. In some 
	cases of complex repeat structure it is also possible that
	the assembly may be incorrect even in the absence of gaps.
	Also, sometimes ambiguities in the data cause a BAC clone to be 
	split, with parts of it placed at opposite ends of a run of other clones.	
	Localized errors of this type should be corrected by additional 
	finishing efforts at the individual sequencing centers and 
	should not be reported to UCSC. However, please report any
	large-scale or systematic problems you detect with this assembly	
	that could have been caused by our data processing.</P>

	<P>The tracks available on the August 2001 browser are quite
	limited at the moment. More tracks will show up over time.</P>

                <P>The April 2001 assembly is now the default for the browser.
        The SNP and Ensembl gene tracks have come in for this version.
        There is also a new track depicting non-human vertebrate mRNA
        alignments.</P>
                <P>The Sept. 2000 and July 2000 versions of the genome are        
        now only available on our archive site.  Please see the link
        in the blue box to the left for more details.</P>
                <P>The August 6 freeze is progressing through the pipeline.
        We've recently received an updated accession map from Wash U.
        Ensembl will shortly be integrating this with chromosome
        specific maps from the sequencing centers.  We are still
        on track for an early September next release.  </P>

		<P> Meanwhile we've been continuing work on the genome browser.  
  	It's now possible  to upload your own annotations to be displayed 
  	alongside the  built-in tracks.  Please scroll to the bottom of the 
 	browser gateway pages for further information.  The browser has 
  	also been sped  up, particularly on the larger chromosomes by 
  	using a 'binning'  technique suggested by Lincoln Stein and Richard Durbin.</P>

		<P>Tracks continue to be added to the 
	<A HREF="/goldenPath/apr2001Tracks.html">April 2001 browser</A>.
	Our old friend the Exofish track is back.  The blat mouse homology
	track is now up as well, computed at somewhat more sensitive settings
	than it was in the 
	<A HREF="/goldenPath/decTracks.html">December 2000 browser.</A></P>
		<P>We've recently received some significant funding from NHGRI to
	maintain and extend this site.  This has allowed us among other things
	to hire an artist, Jenny Draper, who is responsible for the new look.</P>

<P>July 13, 2001: fixed bug where some UTRs were
mis-annotated in the known genes on the minus strand.</P>
<P>April 5, 2001: chromosome level files (but not contig level files)
updated to fix bug where some of the centromeres were misplaced</P>
<P>April 1, 2001: chromosome Y updated to fix a bug that put a large
gap between each clone.  This bug was limited to the Y chromosome.</P>

<hr><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#006666">Oct. 7, 2000 Freeze</FONT>
<P>April 7, 2001: Affymetrix gene predictions updated and available
for bulk download.</P>
<P>January 9, 2001: all files were updated after a bug that had caused
some finished clones to be flipped in the assembly was caught and fixed.
Our apologies for any inconvenience this has caused.

<P>November 10, 2000: the sequence (.fa) files for two contigs:
X/ctg18523/ctg18523.fa and 7/ctg15082/ctg15082.fa were updated.
These files had null (zero valued) characters that have been
replaced with N characters.  These characters were a result of
a mismatch between clone sizes in the map and in finished NT
contigs.  The sequence for chromosomes X and 7, which contain
these contigs, has also been updated.</P>

<hr><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#006666">Sept. 5, 2000 Freeze</FONT>
<P>October 11, 2000: chr21.agp and chr22.fa were updated.  chr21.agp
was a version which went with the UCSC draft assembly rather than the
Sanger/NCBI final assembly of this chromosome.  chr21.agp and chr21.fa
are now in sync.   chr22.fa and chr22.agp were also previously out of
sync.  chr22.fa was obtained from Sanger while chr22.agp had been obtained
by NCBI.  With this update they are consistent, both NCBI versions.
Apologies for any rework this causes you. </P>

<P>October 9, 2000: chr21_random.* and chr22_random.* were removed from
the zip-files in the September 5th freeze.  These files were relics that
should not have been included in the first place.  The files
chr9_random.agp, chr10_random.agp, chr11_random.agp, chr12_random.agp,
chr13_random.agp and chr14_random.agp were updated.  There was a bug
where the initial field of the initial lines in these files was
"(null)" rather than "chrN_random" as it should have been. </P>

<P>September 22, 2000: The zip-files chromFa.zip and chromAgp.zip under the
<A HREF="http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/17july2000/bigZips/">July 17th full data set </A>
were updated to fix some duplications of clone contigs that occurred in the chrN_random.agp and chrN_random.fa
files contained within these zip-files. These "_random" files are files that contain clone contigs that were mapped to a particular chromosome, but
could not be placed at a specific position within that chromosome. They correspond to the "RANDOM" sections of the WashU map. 
None of the regular chrN.agp or chrN.fa files were affected by this update, nor was any of the information in the 
contigAgp.zip or contigFa.zip files changed. For convenience, we include two new files, chromRandAgp.zip and
chromRandFa.zip, for users who would like to download only the data that has changed. These zips consist of
the updated chrN_random.agp and chrN_random.fa files, respectively.

<P>September 4, 2000: The files chromFa.zip and contigFa.zip under the
<A HREF="http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/17july2000/bigZips/">July 17th full data set </A> and the files under 
<A HREF="http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/17july2000/pieces/">
July 17th data by individual clone contig </A>
were updated to fix some incorrect (null(0))
characters that needed to be replaced by 'n' characters in some
Fasta files. The following contig Fasta files on chromosomes 1,8,11,12,16,
17 and 19 were affected:
