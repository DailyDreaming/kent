  	      <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#006666">Posted on 2 Feb. 2005 - Affymetrix ChIp/Chip and PolyA RNA data released</FONT><BR>
		    <P>
		    A second set of ENCODE ChIp/Chip data is now available on 
		    the July 2003 human genome assembly:
<PRE>
    ChIp/Affy Pol2 Pval
    ChIp/Affy Pol2 Sites
    RNA/Affy Signal
    RNA/Affy Sites
</PRE>
		    These tracks show RNA Polymerase II precipitation and 
		    RNA abundance in retinoic acid-stimulated HL-60 cells at 
		    0, 2, 8, and 32 hours, as measured by Affymetrix tiling 
		    arrays in the non-repetitive ENCODE regions.  The 
		    <em>Pval</em> and <em>Signal</em> tracks show values 
		    for each tiled probe; the <em>Sites</em> tracks show 
		    contiguous regions of enrichment.
		    <P>
		    A new <em>composite</em> track display was developed to 
		    concisely display multiple data sets of similar types, a 
		    common feature of ENCODE data.  Each of these new tracks 
		    contains 4 subtracks, one for each time interval.  The 
		    subtracks share a single description page and set of 
		    visibility controls.  Checkboxes on the track 
		    configuration page allow selected subtracks to be hidden 
		    in the display.
		    <P>
		    These data were generated and analyzed by Tom Gingeras' 
		    group at 
		    <A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com"
		    TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix</A> and  
		    <A HREF="http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/bbs/fac/struhl.html" 
		    TARGET=_blank>Kevin Struhl's group at Harvard Medical 
		    School</A>. We would like to thank Stefan Bekiranov at 
		    Affymetrix for submitting the data and working closely 
		    with us to clarify the experimental methods and 
		    verification descriptions.

		    <P>
		    The first datasets submitted for the ENCODE project are 
		    now publicly available:
		    <UL>
		      <LI>
 		      ChIP/chip and transcription (Ludwig Institute/UCSD)

		      <LI>
		      DNaseI hypersensitive sites (NHGRI)
		    </UL>
		    These tracks are visible in the ENCODE track group of the 
		    July 2003 (hg16) human genome assembly.  We would like to 
		    thank the labs of Bing Ren (LI/UCSD), Anindya Dutta (UVA),
		    Rick Myers (Stanford), and Francis Collins (NHGRI) for

  	      <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#006666">Posted on 26 Oct. 2004 - Sequence Freeze For Multiple Alignments</FONT><BR>
		    <P>
		    We are pleased to release the first "official" sequence 
		    data freeze for the ENCODE multiple sequence alignment 
		    projects. The data formats are described in the 
		    <A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg16/encode/alignments/OCT-2004/README.txt" 
		    TARGET=_blank>README</A> file, and the sequences and 
		    supporting information is collected in the 
		    <A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg16/encode/alignments/OCT-2004" 
		    TARGET=_blank> data directory</A>.
		    <P>
		    The species included in this freeze are as follows:
<PRE>
       _SPECIES_      _SOURCE_
        Human           hg16
        Chimpanzee      panTro1
        Dog             canFam1
        Rat             rn3
        RatB	        BCM
        Mouse           mm5
        Chicken		galGal2
        Galago		NISC
        Baboon		NISC
        Marmoset        NISC
        Armadillo       NISC
        Platypus        NISC
</PRE>
		    You will notice that we have worked hard to include a 
		    number of species for which genome-wide sequence data was 
		    already available. The process by which these orthologous 
		    regions were identified is still an area of active 
		    research development, the details of which will be 
		    presented at the upcoming ENCODE meeting at CSHL.
		    <P>
		    Please note that we have also included a *second* rat 
		    sequence (ratB) in this freeze.  RatB represents an 
		    initiative to standardize the quality level of sequences 
		    in the ENCODE regions for species with genome-wide 
		    sequence data. The data were made available just before 
		    our freeze date, so we decided to include both versions of
		    the rat sequence for now. Eventually these sequences will 
		    likely be rolled into future genome assemblies.
		    <P>
		    Remember, this is a work in progress, so not all targets 
		    have sequence from all species. And some species/target 
		    combinations may not be complete yet. Progress on the 
		    NISC-generated sequences can be found at the 
		    <A HREF="http://www.nisc.nih.gov/open_page.html?/projects/encode/index.cgi" 
		    TARGET=_blank> NISC ENCODE Project: Comparative 
		    Sequencing</A>.
		    <P>
		    Many people have worked very hard to make these data 
		    available. Special thanks to Daryl Thomas, Kate 
		    Rosenbloom and the entire UCSC Team; Greg Schuler and the 
		    NCBI team; Colin Dewey and Lior Pachter; Pam Thomas and 
		    the NISC team; and David Wheeler and the BCM team.

		    <P>
		    We are proud to announce the release of features
		    in the UCSC Genome Browser that are tailored to
		    the ENCODE project community, including this home
		    page to consolidate these resources.
		    <P>
		    The initial resources include sequences for the current 
		    human assemblies (hg16, hg15, hg13, and hg12), sequence of
		    the comparative species from 
		    <A HREF="http://www.nisc.nih.gov/" TARGET=_blank>NISC</A>,
		    tools for coordinate conversion between human
		    assemblies, format descriptions for data
		    submission, and contact information for help with
		    submitting annotation data and analyses.
		    <P>
		    Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotations may
		    be obtained from the ENCODE Project 
		    <!--<A HREF="ftp://genome-test.cse.ucsc.edu/encode/downloads/">FTP</A> or -->
		    <A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/encode/">Downloads</A>
