        <p><a href="">Guidelines for Experiments Page</a><br />
        The consortium has adopted uniform guidelines for the most common ENCODE experiments.  
        The guidelines have evolved over time, as technologies have changed. The current guidelines 
        are informed by results gathered during the project. Previous versions of the standards are 
        also posted for reference.

        <p><a href="">Platform Characterization Page</a><br/>
        ENCODE datasets are collected using a variety of platforms, such as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq.
        The consortium has undertaken several efforts to characterize these platforms to better 
        understand the data being collected using them.  Some of these efforts are described on this page.
