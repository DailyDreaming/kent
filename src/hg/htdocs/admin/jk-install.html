<h4>
INSTALLING:</h4>
1. Create a directory named "jksrc" and go to it.
<p>2. Unzip jksrcXXX.zip, where XXX is the latest version, currently 411.
<p>3. Check that the environment variable MACHTYPE exists on your system.&nbsp;
It should on Unix.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; (And making this on non-Unix systems is beyond the scope
of this README).&nbsp; For a Linux
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; system MACHTYPE will probably be 'i386', for Alpha it
will be 'alpha', for a Sun probably 'sparc'.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; If necessary set up this environment variable.
<p>4. Make the directory ~/bin/$MACHTYPE which is where the (non-web) executables
will go.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add this directory to your path.
<p>5. Go to the jksrc/lib directory and type make.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Alphas there will be some warning messages about
"crudeAli.c" otherwise it should compile
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cleanly under gcc.
<p>6. If you need to make an application in the "hg" directory do the following:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. If you have MySQL installed make the environment
variable MYSQLINC point to where it's
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; include files are. (On my
system they are at MYSQLDATA/include. Please refer to the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://genome-test.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/mirror-beta.html">previous
page</a> for the definition of MYSQLDATA.) While you're at it set the MYSQLLIBS
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; variable to point to "MYSQLDATA/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.a&nbsp;
/usr/lib/libz.a"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. If you don't have mysql installed, edit the makefile
to remove 'jksql.o' and -I$(MYSQLINC).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; You may need to edit the makefile so that
the executable files will be moved to WEBROOT/cgi-bin
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Type make.&nbsp; It should compile with no warnings.
<p>7. Go to the application you want to make and type make.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Human Genome Browser, the most important directories
that you need to compile are&nbsp; hg/lib,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hg/hgTracks, hg/hgc, and hg/hgBlat (in that order).
