This directory contains several versions of the stand-alone liftOver utility.
Download the version appropriate for your operating system and run it 
from your command line.  

The tool converts genome coordinates and genome annotation files 
between assemblies. The current version supports both forward and reverse 
conversions, as well as conversions between selected species.

To lift genome annotations locally on Linux or Mac systems, download the 
appropriate liftOver executable and the appropriate chain file. After 
downloading, you may need to change the permissions on the file to turn 
it into an executable.  Run liftOver with no arguments to see the usage 
message.

Files included in this directory:

  - liftOver.MacOSX.ppc: liftOver executable for Mac OSX.

  - liftOver.linux.i386: liftOver executable for Linux 32-bit machine.

  - liftOver.linux.x86_64: liftOver executable for Linux 64-bit machine.
