		    <P>We are pleased to announce the release of a new 
		    Conservation track based on the human (hg18) assembly.  
		    This track shows multiple alignments of 44 vertebrate 
		    species and measurements of evolutionary conservation using
		    two methods (phastCons and phyloP) from the PHAST package, 
		    for all species (vertebrate) and two subsets (primate and 
		    placental mammal). The multiple alignments were generated 
		    using multiz and other tools in the UCSC/Penn State 
		    Bioinformatics comparative genomics alignment pipeline. 
		    Conserved elements identified by phastCons are also 
		    displayed in this track.<P>

		    <P>For more details, visit the track description 
		    <A HREF="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg18&g=cons44way">page</A></P>
		    <P>This track is now the default Conservation track for the
		    human assembly; it replaces the previous 28-vertebrate 
		    Conservation track.  However, the previous 28-Way is still 
		    available: it is now named "28-Way Cons".</P>

		    <P>Many people contributed to the creation of this track 
		    including, but not limited to:</P>
		    <LI>Adam Siepel (Cornell University): phastCons, phyloP, and other programs in the PHAST package</LI>
		    <LI>Webb Miller, Bob Harris &amp; Minmei Hou (Penn State Bioinformatics Group): blastz and multiz</LI>
		    <LI>from the UCSC Genome Browser team: Hiram Clawson, Tim Dreszer, Brian Raney, Kate Rosenbloom &amp; Ann Zweig</LI>
