		    <FONT FACE="courier" SIZE=3><B>8 Oct. 2007 - New Browser for Purple Sea Urchin</B></FONT><BR>
		    <P>
		    The Sep. 2006 release of the purple sea urchin genome 
		    (<em>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</em>) is now available
		    in the UCSC Genome Browser. This assembly, UCSC version
		    strPur2, was produced by the Baylor College of Medicine 
		    Human Genome Sequencing Center (BCM HGSC) and corresponds 
		    to their Spur_2.1 assembly. </P>
		    <P>
		    The Spur_2.1 release was assembled from BAC sequence reads 
		    (approximately 2x coverage) and whole genome shotgun 
		    reads (6x coverage). The BCM HGSC Atlas-2.0 genome 
		    assembly system was used to generate this assembly.
		    Compared to previous sea urchin releases, the Spur_2.1 
		    assembly is more continuous and has fewer false 
		    duplications.
		    This draft assembly may contain errors; therefore, users 
		    should exercise caution. Typical errors may include 
		    misassemblies of repeat sequences, 
		    collapses of repeat regions, and artificial duplications in 
		    polymorphic regions. However, base accuracy in contigs is 
		    usually very high with most errors near the ends of contigs.
		    </P>
		    <P>
		    More assembly details can be found in the 
		    <A HREF="ftp://ftp.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/pub/data/Spurpuratus/fasta/Spur_v2.1/README_Spur_v2.1.txt"

		    <P>

		    available via the Genome Browser

		    <FONT FACE="courier" SIZE=3><B>4 Oct. 2007 - ENCODE Genome Browser Released for hg18 Assembly</B></FONT><BR>
		    <P>
		    The UCSC ENCODE browser for the human genome assembly hg18 
		    (NCBI Build 36) is now available. You can access the browser
		    directly at 
		    <A HREF="encode.hg18.html">http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/encode.hg18.html</A> 
		    or by clicking the ENCODE link in the sidebar menu on this 
		    page, then clicking the Regions (hg18) link in the sidebar 
		    menu on the ENCODE portal page.</P>
		    <P>
		    The hg18 ENCODE browser includes 540 data tables in 59 
		    browser tracks that were migrated from the hg17 browser. 
		    The hg17 data coordinates were converted to hg18 coordinates
		    using the UCSC liftOver process.</P>
		    <P>
		    To improve the accessibility of the data, related ENCODE 
		    tracks have been gathered into new configuration groupings 
		    (&quot;super-tracks&quot;) that can be displayed or hidden
		    using a single visiblity control.  We have also reduced the
 		    number of track groups and have modified some of the group 
		    names for clarity. ENCODE tracks with whole-genome data 
		    have been moved into the standard browser track groups.</P>
		    <P>
		    For more information about the hg18 ENCODE data migration, 
		    see the News section on the UCSC 
		    <A HREF="ENCODE/">ENCODE portal page</A> and the UCSC 
		    <A HREF="http://genomewiki.cse.ucsc.edu/index.php/ENCODE_Hg18_Migration" TARGET=_blank>genomeWiki</A>.</P>
