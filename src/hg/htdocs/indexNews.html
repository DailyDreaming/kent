<FONT FACE="courier" SIZE="3"><B>13 Jan. 2010 - Lifespan of Custom Tracks within Sessions</B></FONT>
<P>
Due to the popularity of our Custom Tracks and Session tools, we are running 
out of disk space for saving Custom Tracks within Sessions.  Although Sessions 
themselves are saved for one year, user-generated tracks 
within Sessions (including Custom Tracks) are saved at the normal rate for all 
Custom Tracks: 48 hours.  However, until now, because we have had space 
available on the server, we have been attempting to keep Custom Tracks alive for 
the lifetime of the <A HREF="goldenPath/help/hgSessionHelp.html">Session</A>.
</P>
<P>
Over the next few days, we are going to start actively deleting Custom Tracks 
within Sessions that have not been accessed within the past 4 months.  If you 
actively use your Custom Tracks within saved Sessions, they will not be deleted.
</P>
<P>
While we provide short-term Custom Track storage as a service to users who want 
to view their own data in the UCSC Genome Browser, please keep in mind that we 
are not a data warehousing service; we do not have the resources and cannot 
guarantee long-term data storage.
</P>
<P>
Instead of uploading your data to our servers, please consider using alternate 
data types such as 
<A HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bigBed.html">bigBed</A>, 
<A HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bigWig.html">bigWig</A>, 
or other URL-based tracks.
