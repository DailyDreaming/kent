		    Genes Track Released for GRCh37/hg19</B></FONT>
                    <P>
		    We're happy to announce the release of an updated UCSC Genes
		    track for the GRCh37/hg19 human Genome Browser. This release
		    includes more noncoding transcripts based on data from 
		    <A HREF="http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/" TARGET=_blank>Rfam</A> 
		    and from the 
		    <A HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=tRNAs">tRNA Genes track</A> 
		    contributed by the <A HREF="http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/" 
		    TARGET=_blank>Todd Lowe lab</A> at UCSC.
		    <P>
		    The new release has 80,922 total transcripts, compared with 
		    77,614 in the previous version. The total number of 
		    canonical genes has increased from 27,297 to 31,227. 
		    Comparing the new gene set with the previous version: 
		    <UL>
		    <LI>24,804 transcripts did not change between versions.
		    <LI>483 transcripts were not carried forward to the new 
		    version.
		    <LI>46,367 transcripts are "compatible" with those in the 
		    previous set, meaning that the two transcripts show 
		    consistent splicing. In most cases, the old and new 
		    transcripts differ in the lengths of their UTRs.
		    <LI>5,960 transcripts overlap with those in the previous 
		    set but do not show consistent splicing, i.e., they contain 
		    overlapping introns with differing splice sites.
		    </UL>
		    <P>
		    Additionally, several improvements where made to the UCSC 
		    Genes build pipeline:
		    <UL>
		    <LI>We developed new genomic alignment protocols for 
		    aligning short sequences, facilitating the expansion of the 
		    noncoding RNA content.
		    <LI>
		    We changed the way that gene symbols are assigned to 
		    transcripts so that names from curated sources are favored 
		    over names coming directly from GenBank mRNA records. This 
		    change resolved several confusing naming issues reported to 
		    us by users.
		    <LI>We tracked down and corrected a bug in the pipeline that
		    was causing a number of poor quality protein mappings to 
		    displace high quality protein mappings.
		    <LI>We have started producing two new tables, 
		    knownGeneTxMrna and knownGeneTxPep, that contain sequence 
		    derived from the genome rather than from the mRNA used for 
		    the transcript.
		    </UL>
		    <P>
		    More details about the new UCSC Genes track can be found on the 
		    <A HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=knownGene">UCSC Genes track description page</A>.
		    <P>
		    Many thanks to Melissa Cline, Jim Kent, Brian Raney, Mark 
		    Diekhans, and Brooke Rhead for their work on this track!
