        New!  Expanded onsite workshop program!</b> </font>
        </p>
        <p>
        Explore the full power of the UCSC Genome Browser! Thanks to the funding support
        of NHGRI, we can now offer hands-on Genome Browser training onsite at your
        institution, tailored to your audience's level of expertise. Through this
        program, the services of our expert trainer are provided for free, and
        participating institutions cover only the transportation from UCSC, lodging,
        and a flat fee to cover other costs.

        All the DNA on the internet now at your fingertips!</b></font>
        </p>
        <p>
        We're pleased to announce the release of the Web Sequences track on the UCSC Genome Browser. This 
 	track, produced in collaboration with Microsoft Research, contains the results of a 30-day scan for 
	DNA sequences from over 40 billion different webpages. The sequences were then mapped with Blat to 
	the human genome (hg19) and numerous other species including mouse (mm9), rat (rn4), and zebrafish 
	(danRer7). The data were extracted from a variety of sources including patents, online textbooks, 
	help forums, and any other webpages that contain DNA sequence. In essence, this track displays the 
	Blat alignments of nearly every DNA sequence on the internet! The 
	<A HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=pubsBingBlat">Web Sequences</A> 
	track description page contains more details on how the track was generated.
        </p>
        <p>
        We would like to acknowledge Max Haeussler and Matt Speir from the UCSC Genome Browser staff
        and Bob Davidson from Microsoft Research for their hard work in creating this track.
