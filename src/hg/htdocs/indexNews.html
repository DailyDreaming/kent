                    Browser Session-Sharing Function Available </B></FONT>
                    <P>
                    We are pleased to announce the release of a new session 
                    management functionality 
                    in the Genome Browser, which allows users to save and
                    share browser sessions.</P>
                    <P>
                    Users are now able to configure their browsers with specific
                    track combinations, including custom tracks, and 
                    save the configuraton options.  Multiple sessions may
                    be saved for future reference, for comparison of scenarios
                    or for sharing with colleagues.  Saved sessions persist for
                    one year after the last access, unless deleted.  Custom tracks 
                    persist for at least 48 hours after
                    the last time they are viewed. </P>
                    <P>
                    The new feature may be accessed via the "Sessions" link
                    in the top blue bar in any assembly.  To ensure privacy
                    and security, users must login to the genomewiki site
                    and create a username and password.  Individual sessions
                    may be designated by the user as either "shared" or 
                    "non-shared" to protect the privacy of confidential data.
                    <P>
                    To avoid having a new shared session from someone else
                    override existing Genome Browser settings,
                    users are encouraged to open a new web-browser instance
                    or to save existing settings in a session before loading
                    a new shared session.
                    <P>
                    The Sessions feature was written by Angie Hinrichs of the 
                    UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group and released with the 
                    assistance of Kayla Smith and Robert Kuhn.</P>

                    <P>
                    We are pleased to announce the release of a new software 
                    tool in the Genome Browser collection, the 
                    <A HREF="cgi-bin/hgGenome">Genome Graphs</A> 
                    tool. Genome Graphs offers the ability to 
                    upload and display genome-wide data sets such as the 
                    results of genome-wide SNP association studies, linkage 
                    studies and homozygosity mapping.
