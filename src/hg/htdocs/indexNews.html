New ENCODE Integrated Regulation Super-track Released</B></FONT>
		    <P>
		    We are pleased to announce the release of the ENCODE Integrated
		    Regulation super-track, a collection of regulatory tracks containing
		    state-of-the-art information about the mechanisms that turn genes on and
		    off at the transcription level. Individual tracks within the set show
		    enrichment of histone modifications suggestive of enhancer and promoter
		    activity, DNAse clusters indicating open chromatin, regions of
		    transcription factor binding, and transcription levels. When viewed in
		    combination, the complementary nature of the data within these tracks
		    has the potential to greatly facilitate our understanding of regulatory
		    DNA. 
		    </P>
		    <P>
		    The data comprising these tracks were generated from hundreds of
		    experiments on multiple cell lines conducted by labs participating in
		    the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, and were submitted to
		    the UCSC ENCODE Data Coordination Center for display on the Genome
		    Browser.
		    </P>
		    <P>
		    Faced with the problem of how to display such a large amount of data
		    in a manner facilitating analysis, UCSC has developed new visualization
		    methods that cluster and overlay the data, and then display the
		    resulting tracks on a single screen. Each of the cell lines in a track
		    is associated with a particular color. Light, saturated colors are used
		    to produce the best transparent overlay.

		    </P>
		    <P>
		    The data in the ENCODE Regulation super-track, as with all data from the
		    production phase of the ENCODE project, have genome-wide coverage. In
		    general, Genome Browser tracks that show ENCODE-generated data can be
		    identified by the double-helix icon preceding the name in the track
		    list. Currently, the ENCODE Regulation data are available only on the
		    March 2006 (NCBI Build 36, UCSC version hg18) assembly of the human
		    genome. 
		    </P>
		    <P>
		    For a detailed description of the datasets contained in this super-track
		    and a discussion of how the tracks can be used synergistically to
		    examine regions of regulatory functionality within the genome, see the
		    <A HREF="http://tiny.cc/ntvjk">track description</A> page.
