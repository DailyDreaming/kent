		    <P>
		    The Center for Biomolecular Science &amp; Engineering (CBSE) invites applications from 
		    outstanding PhD- or MD-level scientists for two distinct positions. 
		    Position is open until filled, but applications received after March 27 
		    may not be considered.<BR><BR>
		    <EM>Cancer Genomics Director</EM>
		    <P>We seek an independent, creative scientist with cancer research experience to guide 
the group in building our cancer genomics data analysis platform into an essential tool for cancer research 
and an engine for personalized, genome-based cancer treatment. The successful candidate will extend our 
existing cancer research collaborations, conceptualize new research directions, oversee their 
implementation by our outstanding postdoctoral students and scientific programming staff, write papers and 
present results at scientific meetings, and apply for additional grants. Our exceptional collegiality and 
interdisciplinary collaborations make UCSC an excellent environment for an innovative scientist who can 
benefit from and contribute to the rapid growth in the sciences and engineering at UCSC.
