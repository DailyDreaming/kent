Searching for Tracks Just Got Easier!</B></FONT>
		    <P>
		    The number of genome assemblies and annotation
		    tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser has increased 
		    exponentially over the past few years. Along with this 
		    growth, it has become more difficult for browser users to 
		    sort through the many tracks to find the data they're 
		    interested in.
		    <P>
		    With our latest Genome Browser release, we've introduced a 
		    new track search feature that will help you to quickly and 
		    easily find and display specific annotation data sets. The 
		    search feature is available via the "track search" button 
		    on the browser gateway and tracks display pages.
		    <P>
		    The default search takes one or more terms as input, and 
		    returns a list of all the browser tracks in which the name,
		    description, group or associated metadata contains the 
		    terms. The advanced search option lets the user fine-tune 
		    the search based on the track name, description, and group.
		    Individuals interested in the ENCODE data available on 
		    selected human genome assemblies can use the advanced 
		    search to specify particular ENCODE metadata terms, such 
		    as cell line, experiment type, etc.
		    <BR><BR>

                    alt="Track search screenshot">
		    <BR>
		    Once the list of search results is shown, you may choose 
		    which tracks you'd like to view in the browser, and can 
		    adjust the display modes. The search results list is 
		    sortable by multiple criteria, and provides direct links 
		    to detailed track descriptions and additional information 
		    about the tracks.
		    <P>
		    Special thanks to Tim Dreszer and Larry Meyer for 
		    implementing track search, and to the QA team 
		    for their work in testing and finetuning it. We hope our 
		    users, particularly those exploring ENCODE 
		    data, will take advantage of this new feature. As always, 
		    we appreciate your feedback. Please send comments or 
		    questions to

                    <P>
		    It is now possible to rearrange the order that tracks appear
		    in the browser image directly from the browser image itself.
		    To reorder tracks, click-and-hold the side label or gray 
		    mini-button of a single track and drag the highlighted track
		    to a new position within the image.
