		    <P>
		    The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) seeks 
		    community comments on the future of its large-scale genome 
		    sequencing program. To stimulate discussion, NHGRI has 
		    produced a white paper, "The Future of Genome Sequencing". 
		    If you'd like to review the paper or would like more 
		    information on NHGRI's long-range planning process, please 
		    visit their <A HREF="http://www.genome.gov/About/Planning/"
		    TARGET=_blank>planning website</A>. </P>

                       PCR Tool</B></FONT><BR>
		    <P>
		    Many Genome Browser users are familiar with UCSC's
		    <A HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgPcr"><EM>in-silico</EM> 
		    PCR tool</A>, which searches a sequence database with a 
		    pair of PCR primers, using an indexing strategy for fast 
		    performance. In response to requests from users and staff, 
		    we have extended the functionality of this tool to allow 
		    the query of transcribed sequences. Using primers within 
		    the exonic regions of a gene, you can see a graphical view 
		    of the predicted PCR product.  The gene is shown in all of 
		    its isoforms with the introns removed.  
		    </P>
		    <P>
		    This new functionality, which is based on the UCSC Genes 
		    annotation, is currently available for human assemblies 
		    hg16, hg17, and hg18, and mouse assemblies mm8 and mm9. To 
		    try it out, select one of the supported assemblies from the 
		    In-Silico PCR Genome and Assembly menus, and then choose 
		    the "UCSC Genes" option from the Target menu.

		    We are pleased to announce the release of a new 
		    Conservation track based on the human (hg18) assembly.  
		    This track shows multiple alignments of 44 vertebrate 
		    species and measurements of evolutionary conservation.
