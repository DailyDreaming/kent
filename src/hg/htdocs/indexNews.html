		    TARGET=_blank>A Draft Sequence of the Neandertal Genome</A>
		    in the May 7 issue of <em>Science</em>, the UCSC
		    Genome Browser project will be releasing a public 
		    Neandertal portal later today that may be 
		    used to access the Neandertal sequence, alignments to
		    the UCSC hg18 (NCBI Build 36) human reference assembly and
		    the UCSC panTro2 (Chimp Genome Sequencing Consortium v2.1)

		    analyses.
		    <P>
		    Neandertals are the closest extinct relatives of humans. 
		    They lived from several hundred thousand years ago until 
		    their disappearance approximately 30,000 years ago. 
		    The Neandertal genome sequence consists of short sequence 
		    fragments, usually about 50 base pairs long, mapped to the 
		    human reference genome. The sequence was 
		    derived primarily from DNA extracted from 
		    three Neanderthal bones, each about 40,000 years old, found 
		    in the Vindija Cave in Croatia; smaller amounts of data were
		    also obtained from three bones from other sites. The bulk 
		    sequencing was carried out on the Illumina GAII platform. 
		    Neandertal DNA was differentiated from the background of 
		    microbial sequences in the bone by similarity to the human 
		    or chimpanzee genomes.
		    <P>
		    The draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome yields 
		    important new insights into the evolution of modern humans.
	            Among the findings discussed in the <em>Science</em>
		    publication is evidence that some early modern 
		    humans, after their migration out of Africa, interbred with 
		    Neanderthals, resulting in traces of Neanderthal DNA 
		    sequences in the genomes of present-day non-Africans. The
		    authors also cataloged genetic features unique to modern 
		    humans by comparing the Neanderthal, human, and chimpanzee 
		    genomes. Among the genes highlighted in the study as 
		    likely to have undergone important changes in recent human 
		    evolution are those involved in cognitive development, 
		    skull structure, energy metabolism, skin morphology and 
		    physiology. 
		    <P>
		    We'd like to thank Richard Green and the many authors
		    on the <em>Science</em> paper for providing the UCSC Genome
		    Browser with these data. We'd also like to acknowledge the
		    hard work of the UCSC Genome Browser staff who pulled 
		    together the annotations and information for the Neandertal 
		    portal: Angie Hinrichs, Katrina Learned, and Pauline Fujita.
