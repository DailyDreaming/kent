		    <P>The UCSC Genome Browser website is now back online 
		    after being offline for nearly 24 hours. The entire Santa Cruz area lost 
		    internet and phone service for most of the day on 9 April after vandals 
		    cut fiber optic lines serving our area. Thank you for your patience while we were 
		    offline. Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.

		    <P>
		    The Center for Biomolecular Science &amp; Engineering (CBSE) invites applications from 
		    outstanding PhD- or MD-level scientists for two distinct positions. 
		    Position is open until filled, but applications received after March 27 
		    may not be considered.<BR><BR>
		    <EM>Cancer Genomics Director</EM>
		    <P>We seek an independent, creative scientist with cancer research experience to guide 
the group in building our cancer genomics data analysis platform into an essential tool for cancer research 
and an engine for personalized, genome-based cancer treatment. The successful candidate will extend our 
existing cancer research collaborations, conceptualize new research directions, oversee their 
implementation by our outstanding postdoctoral students and scientific programming staff, write papers and 
present results at scientific meetings, and apply for additional grants. Our exceptional collegiality and 
interdisciplinary collaborations make UCSC an excellent environment for an innovative scientist who can 
benefit from and contribute to the rapid growth in the sciences and engineering at UCSC.

		    <EM>Medical Genomics Director</EM>
		    <P>We seek an independent, creative scientist who can guide the group in the direction of 
clinical diagnostics, pediatric/prenatal diagnostics, personalized medicine, pharmacogenomics, or related 
fields, building on the exceptional genome analysis resources at UCSC. The successful candidate will interface 
with the medical community, conceptualize genomics projects, oversee implementation by the scientific 
programming staff, write papers describing the projects, and apply for grants to fund future projects.

		    <P>
		    We'd like to invite everyone to explore UCSC's 
		    <A HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/">ENCODE Data
		    Coordination Center</A> website, as well as the ENCODE data 
		    displayed as annotation tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser.
		    Today's 
		    <A HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg18&g=wgEncodeYaleChIPseq">featured 
		    dataset</A> is a track showing transcription factor 
		    binding sites determined by ChIP-seq, produced through a 
		    collaboration of Yale University, University of CA Davis,  
		    and Harvard University. Many more tracks from the Feb. 2009
		    and Dec. 2008 ENCODE data freezes will become available
		    on the UCSC Genome Browser in upcoming weeks. To monitor
		    the ENCODE data releases in the Genome Browser, see the
