		    <P>
		    We've added the Jul. 2008 release of the zebra finch genome 
		    (<em>Taeniopygia guttata</em>) to our collection of 
		    vertebrate genome browsers. The v3.2.4 draft assembly
		    (UCSC version taeGut1) was produced by the Genome Sequencing
		    Center at the Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL) 
		    School of Medicine in St. Louis, MO, USA. 
		    </P>
		    <P>
		    The zebra finch genome is the second bird genome to be
		    sequenced (following the chicken, <em>Gallus gallus</em>).
		    The DNA used for the shotgun sequencing and the BAC and
		    cosmid libraries was derived from a single male zebra finch.
		    The initial assembly was generated using PCAP with 
		    approximately 6X coverage. About 1.0 Gb of the 1.2-Gb 
		    genome has been ordered and oriented along 33 chromosomes 
		    and one linkage group. The chromosome names are based on
		    their homologous chromosomes in the chicken (<em>Gallus 
		    gallus</em>). For more assembly
		    details, as well as a cross reference table of 
		    zebra finch and chicken chromosome names, see the WUSTL

		    <P>
		    The Sep. 2007 EquCab2 release of the horse genome (Equus 
		    caballus) is now available in the UCSC Genome Browser. This 
		    assembly, UCSC version equCab2, was produced by the 
		    <A HREF="http://www.broad.mit.edu/" TARGET=_blank>Broad 
		    Institute</A>. </P>
		    <P>
		    The horse draft genome has been sequenced to 6.8X coverage. 
		    Approximately 84% of the sequence has been anchored to 
		    chromosomes, which include autosomes 1-31 and sex 
		    chromosome X. Unanchored contigs that could not be 
		    localized to a chromosome have been concatenated into the 
		    virtual chromosome &quot;chrUn&quot;, separated by gaps of 
		    1,000 bp. The mitochondrial sequence is also available in
		    the Genome Browser as the virtual chromosome 
		    &quot;chrM&quot;. 
		    <P>
		    The UCSC Genome Browser team has identified an apparent
		    assembly error in the Broad EquCab2 release: a duplicated
		    25.9 Mb region from chr6 is appended to the distal end of 
		    chr27 (visible as scaffold_34 in the Scaffolds track). We 
		    have notified the Broad Institute of this problem, which 
		    likely will be corrected in their next assembly release. 
		    For more details about the current assembly, see 
		    the Broad Institute
