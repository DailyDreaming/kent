		    <P>
		    The UCSC Bioinformatics Group announces your chance to 
		    bring our hands-on computer workshop on the UCSC Genome 
		    Browser to your institution. The seminar is presented by 
		    our training partner, <A HREF="http://www.openhelix.com"
		    TARGET=_blank>OpenHelix</A>.</P>
		    <P>
		    The 3-1/2-hour introductory tutorial will cover the topics 
		    needed to effectively use our tool set, including: basic 
		    functionality of Genome Browser searching and BLAT use, 
		    Table Browser use, creating and using Custom Tracks, and 
		    an introduction to the Gene Sorter. The workshop material
		    requires knowledge of genomic/biological concepts, but no 
		    programming skills are required.
		    Participants will receive slide hand-outs, exercises, and 
		    UCSC Genome Browser and Table Browser Quick Reference Cards.
		    </P>
		    <P>
		    To bring the seminar to your institution, apply on the
