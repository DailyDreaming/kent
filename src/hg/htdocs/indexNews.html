<!-- Wallaby Assembly release  -->
                <FONT FACE="courier" SIZE="3"><B>23 January 2012 - Wallaby Browser Available</B></FONT>
                   <P>
                    We have released a Genome Browser for the September 2009
                    genome assembly of the Tammar Wallaby, <em>Macropus 
                    eugenii</em> (TWGS version Meug_1.1, UCSC version macEug2). This assembly,
                    which has been sequenced to 2X coverage, was produced by
                    the Tammar Wallaby Genome Sequencing Consortium, a collaboration 
		    between the Baylor College of Medicine 
		    <a href="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/project-species-m-Wallaby.hgsc" target="_blank">
	            Human Genome Sequencing Center</a> and the 
		    <a href="http://www.agrf.org.au/default.aspx" target="_blank">Austrailian Genome Research Facility</a>.
                    
                    <P>
                    Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotation data are
                    available via the Genome Browser

                    We'd like to thank the Tammar Wallaby Genome Sequencing Consortium for 
		    providing this assembly. The wallaby Genome Browser and annotation
                    tracks were produced by Chin Li, Luvina Guruvadoo, and Donna Karolchik. See the

		Epigenomics Now Available through Data Hub at Washington 
		University</B></FONT>
		   <P>
		   We are pleased to announce the release of the Roadmap 
		   Epigenomics data on the UCSC Genome Browser through our 
		   Data Hub function. The Roadmap Epigenomics Project is part 
		   of The NIH Common Fund's <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/epigenomics/" 
		   target="_blank">Epigenomics Program</a>. 
		   It was launched with the goal of producing a public resource 
		   of human epigenomic data to catalyze basic biology
		   and disease-oriented research. The Consortium leverages 
		   experimental pipelines built around next-generation sequencing 
		   technologies to map DNA methylation, histone modifications, 
		   chromatin accessibility and small RNA transcripts in stem
		   cells and primary ex vivo tissues selected to represent the 
		   normal counterparts of tissues and organ systems frequently 
		   involved in human disease. The Consortium expects to deliver 
		   a collection of normal epigenomes that will provide a framework 
		   or reference for comparison and integration within a broad
		   array of future studies.
		   <P>
		   All data were produced and processed by the 
		   <a href="http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/" target="_blank">
		   Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium</a>, and will be periodically
		   updated. Genome Browser tracks were constructed and hosted by 
		   <a href="http://vizhub.wustl.edu/" 
		   target="_blank">VizHub</a> at Washington University in St. Louis. 
		   Tracks are available at UCSC Genome Browser via the Data Hub 
		   function, or follow this 
		   <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19&hubUrl=
			http://vizhub.wustl.edu/VizHub/RoadmapRelease4.txt" target="_blank">link</a>. 
		   The Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium is responsible for 
		   the quality of the data.

                Call Format (VCF) Now Supported in Genome Browser</B></FONT>
                   <P>
                   We are pleased to announce that the UCSC Genome Browser
                   now supports Variant Call Format (VCF).  VCF is a flexible
                   and extendable line-oriented text format developed by the
                   1000 Genomes Project for releases of single nucleotide variants,
                   indels, copy number variants and structural variants discovered
                   by the project.  Similar to bigBed, bigWig and BAM, the Browser
                   transfers only the portions of VCF files necessary to display
                   viewed regions, making VCF a fast and attractive option for
                   large data sets.  VCF files will need to be compressed and
                   indexed using the tabix package available from
                   <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/"
                   target="_blank">SAMtools</a>.  This new format is available
                   for use in custom tracks and data hubs.  For more information
                   about VCF and tabix, please see our <a href="goldenPath/help/vcf.html"
                   target="_blank">VCF Track Format help page</a>.</P>
