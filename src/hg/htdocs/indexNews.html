		    <FONT FACE="courier" SIZE=3><B>31 July 2006 - v2.1 Chicken Assembly Available in Genome Browser</B></FONT>
		    <P>
	   	    We have updated the Chicken Genome Browser to include the 
		    May 2006 v2.1 assembly (UCSC version galGal3) produced by 
	 	    the Genome Sequencing Center at the Washington University 
		    School of Medicine in St. Louis, MO, USA (WUSTL). The 
		    source of this sequence was a female inbred Red Jungle Fowl 
		    (<em>Gallus gallus</em>), the ancestor of domestic chickens.
		    The chicken genome is the first of the avian genomes to be 
		    sequenced.
		    <P>
		    In this assembly, 198,000 additional reads covering all 
		    contig ends and regions of low quality have been added to 
		    the original assembly's 6.6X coverage. Approximately 95% of 
		    the sequence has been anchored to chromosomes, which include
	 	    autosomes 1-24, 26-28, and 32, and sex chromosomes W and Z. 
		    (In contrast to mammals, the female chicken is heterogametic
		    (ZW) and the male is homogametic (ZZ).) The remaining 
		    unanchored contigs that could be localized to a chromosome 
		    have been concatenated into the virtual chromosomes 
		    &quot;chr*_random&quot;, separated by gaps of 10,000 bp. 
		    Unanchored contigs that could not be localized to a 
		    chromosome have been concatenated into the virtual 
		    chromosome &quot;chrUn_random&quot;, separated by gaps of 
		    100 bp to reduce the total size of chrUn_random. The chicken
		    mitochondrial sequence is also available as the virtual 
		    chromosome &quot;chrM&quot;. </P>
		    <P>
		    Although centromere positions are indicated on this
		    assembly, little is known of their exact sequence. 
		    The centromeres of 18 chromosomes were tentatively localized
		    based on FISH hybridization using BAC clones, genetic 
		    markers flanking the centromeres in coordination with 
		    mapping gaps in the physical map, repetitive sequence 
		    content, and analysis of proximity to the constrictions of 
		    the mitotic metaphase chromosomes. For more information on 
		    the process used to create the chromosomal sequences and 
		    assign centromere locations, see the WUSTL Gallus gallus

                    We'd like to thank WUSTL, who provided the sequence, 
		    physical map, assembly, and assembly/map for this
		    release. The genetic mapping and linkage analysis were 
		    produced through a collaborative effort of labs in The
		    Chicken Mapping Consortium.  The chicken browser annotation 
		    tracks were generated by UCSC and collaborators worldwide. 
		    See the

		    Chicken Genome Browser was produced by Angie Hinrichs, 
		    Kayla Smith, and Donna Karolchik.</P>
