		    <FONT FACE="courier" SIZE=3><B>26 Jun. 2007 - <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> Release 5 Now Available in Genome Browser</B></FONT><BR>
		    <P>
		    The latest <em>D. melanogaster</em> assembly can now 
		    be viewed in the UCSC Genome Browser. This version -- 
		    Release 5, dated Apr. 2006 (UCSC version dm3) -- was 
		    provided by the <A HREF="http://www.fruitfly.org/" 
		    TARGET=_blank>Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project</A> (BDGP) 
		    and combines both
		    euchromatic and heterochromatic sequence. The Release 5.1 
		    annotations (Mar. 2007) were provided by 
		    <A HREF="http://flybase.net" TARGET=_blank>FlyBase</A>. 
		    <P>
		    The six euchromatic arms in this assembly were sequenced and
		    assembled by BDGP from a combination of BAC and whole genome
		    shotgun data, and have been finished to high quality.  All 
		    euchromatic sequence have been compared to the restriction 
		    digest fingerprints in multiple enzymes for validity.  The 
		    details of this analysis will be described in a forthcoming 
		    publication.  </P>
		    <P>
		    Heterochromatic sequence from the 
		    <A HREF="http://www.dhgp.org/" TARGET=_blank>Drosophila 
		    Heterochromatin Genome Project</A> (DHGP) are also available		    in this assembly. Scaffolds that could not be unambiguously 
		    mapped to a chromosome arm have been concatenated into 
		    chrUn.  chrUextra contains small scaffolds produced by the 
		    Celera shotgun assembler that could not be consistently
		    joined with larger scaffolds. Because some of the 
		    chrUextra data are of low quality, researchers are 
		    encouraged to contact either BDGP or DHGP for further 
		    details on this resource. For more information on this 
		    assembly, see the Release 5 
		    <A HREF="http://www.fruitfly.org/sequence/README.RELEASE5"
		    TARGET=_blank>assembly release notes</A>.  </P>
		    <P>
		    Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotation data are 
		    available via the Genome Browser 
		    <A HREF="ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/dm3/">FTP
		    server</A> or

		    page. 
		    We'd like to thank the BDGP, DHGP, and Flybase for 
		    providing data for this release. The dm3 Genome Browser
		    was produced by Angie Hinrichs, Archana Thakkapallayil,
		    Kayla Smith, and Donna Karolchik.
		    The <em>D. melanogaster</em> browser annotations were 
		    generated by FlyBase, DHGP, and the UCSC Genome 
		    Bioinformatics group. See the 
		    <A HREF="../goldenPath/credits.html#dm_credits">Credits</A>
