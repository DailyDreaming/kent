		    <FONT FACE="courier" SIZE=3><B>13 Jun. 2007 - ENCODE Findings Released to Public</em></B></FONT><BR>
		    <P>
		    The data and findings of the ENCODE project have been 
		    released to the public today, the culmination of a 
		    four-year effort to catalog the biologically functional 
		    elements in 1 percent of the human genome. The publications,
		    which include a group paper in the 14 June 2007 issue of 
		    <A HREF="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7146/full/nature05874.html"
		    TARGET=_blank><em>Nature</em></A> and 28 companion papers in
		    the June 2007
		    issue of <em>Genome Research</em>, were authored by 
		    researchers from academic, governmental, and industry
		    organizations located in 11 countries. The <em>Nature</em> 
		    issue includes a pull-out poster featuring a screenshot of 
		    the UCSC Genome Browser displaying a broad range of the 
		    ENCODE data.</P>
		    <P>
		    In the <A HREF="http://genome.gov/25521554"
		    TARGET=_blank>press release</A> accompanying the publication
		    rollout, NHGRI Director Francis S. Collins is quoted as 
		    saying
		    &quot;This impressive effort has uncovered many exciting 
		    surprises and blazed the way for future efforts to explore 
		    the functional landscape of the entire human genome. Because
		    of the hard work and keen insights of the ENCODE consortium,
		    the scientific community will need to rethink some long-held
		    views about what genes are and what they do, as well as how 
	   	    the genome's functional elements have evolved. This could 
		    have significant implications for efforts to identify the 
		    DNA sequences involved in many human diseases.&quot;</P>
		    <P>
		    The main portal for the ENCODE data is the UCSC ENCODE
		    Genome Browser. The analysis effort has been coordinated
		    from 
		    <A HREF="http://wwww.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens?encode.html" 
		    TARGET=_blank>Ensembl</A>. Much of the primary data have 
		    been deposited in the 
		    <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/ENCODE.html"
		    TARGET=_blank>NCBI GEO</A> and 
		    <A HREF="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/"
		    TARGET=_blank>EBI ArrayExpress</A> databases. 
		    To access the UCSC Genome Browser ENCODE portal, click the
		    <A HREF="ENCODE/">ENCODE</A> link in the left sidebar menu 
		    on the Genome Browser home page.</P>
