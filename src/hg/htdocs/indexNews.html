		    <FONT FACE="courier" SIZE="3"><B>8 Apr. 2008 - Updated Cow Genome Browser Now Available</B></FONT><BR>
		    <P>
		    The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group has released a Genome 
		    Browser and Blat server for the Oct. 2007 draft assembly of
 		    the Cow genome <em>Bos taurus</em>. This assembly 
		    (UCSC version bosTau4) was produced by the Baylor College of 
		    Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center (BCM HGSC) as
		    Baylor release Btau_4.0. </P>
		    <P>
		    The Btau_4.0 release was produced using the 
		    <A HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/14/4/721">Atlas</A>
		    genome assembly system at BCM HGSC. 
		    The sequencing strategy combined BAC shotgun reads with 
		    whole genome shotgun reads from small insert libraries as 
		    well as BAC end sequences. The assembly contains chromosomes
		    1-29 and X as well as 11869 scaffolds (named chrUn.004.*). 
		    The mitochondrial sequence (available in the browser as 
		    &quot;chrM&quot;) was obtained from Genbank accession 
		    GI:60101824.</P>
		    <P>
		    The Btau_4.0 assembly was tested against available bovine 
		    sequence data sets (EST sequences and finished BAC 
		    sequences) for extent of coverage (completeness). When 
		    assembled contigs were tested, over 95% of the sequences in 
		    these data sets were found to be represented, indicating 
		    that the shotgun libraries 
		    used to sequence the genome were comprehensive. Of the 1.04 
		    million EST sequences 95.0% were contained in the assembled 
		    contigs. Assuming the ESTs are uniformly distributed
		    throughout the genome, the estimated genome size is 
		    2.73Gb/95% = 2.87Gb.
		    For detailed information on the sequencing and assembly 
		    techniques, see the Baylor 
		    <A HREF="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/bovine/"
		    TARGET=_blank>Bovine Genome Project</A> web page.</P>
		    <P>

		    assembly, click the &quot;Sequences&quot; link on the cow

		    page. </P> 
		    <P>
		    Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotation data are 
		    available via the Genome Browser

		    server</A> or

		    <A HREF="/goldenPath/credits.html#cow_credits">specific 
		    conditions for use</A>. The cow annotation tracks were 
		    generated by UCSC and collaborators worldwide.</P>
		    <P>
		    We'd like to thank Baylor College of Medicine for providing 
		    this assembly. The UCSC bosTau4 browser and documentation 
		    were produced by Hiram Clawson, Brian Raney, and Ann Zweig.
