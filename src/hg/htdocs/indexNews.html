  <font color="#006666" size="4"><b>7 Apr 2016
  - Data from the Lens PatSeq Database Now Available</b></font>
  <p>
  We are pleased to announce the release of a set of tracks containing data from the
  <a href="https://www.lens.org/" target="_blank">Lens</a>
  PatSeq database in the UCSC Genome Browser. These tracks contain data from the
  <a href="https://www.lens.org/lens/bio" target="_blank">PatSeq</a>
  database mapped to the genome and then colored based on where the sequence appears in
  the patent document. Details pages contain the patent titles with links to the patents in the
  Lens database. The data from PatSeq is divided into two tracks, one includes those sequences
  that were submitted in bulk patents containing 100 or more sequences and the other containing
  all other sequences. These tracks are currently present on the human (hg19), mouse (mm10),
  and Ebola virus (eboVir3) genomes.
  </p>

  <p>
  Thanks to our collaborators at the Lens, Osmat Jefferson and Deniz Koellhofer, for providing the
  data and feedback on the visualization. Thank you to Max Haeussler and Matthew Speir, members of
  the UCSC Genome Browser team, for their efforts in creating these tracks.

  <p>
  We have released a new <A HREF =
  "http://genome.ucsc.edu/training/vids/index.html#vid08" TARGET =
  _BLANK>video</A> to our YouTube channel.  This newest installment in our effort
  to share the capabilities of the Genome Browser shows how to
  use the Table Browser to obtain either the sequences or the coordinates for
  exons in the genes from a chosen region of the genome.
  </p>

  <p>
  We also want to take this opportuinty to remind you that we offer
  on-site <A HREF = "http://genome.ucsc.edu/training/index.html" TARGET =
  _BLANK>workshops</A> to help you and your colleagues make the most out
  of the Genome Browser.

  - Going Back to Our Roots</b></font>
  <p>
  For many years, the UCSC Genome Browser has provided a dynamic, cutting-edge interface for
  viewing genomic data.  As time has gone by, however, it has become clear to us that we
  cannot keep this up.  It is not fair to you, our users, that our interface keeps changing,
  and it has increasingly been a burden on us to keep up with emerging web technologies.  Today
  that all changes, as we return you to the roots of the web: ASCII.
  <p>
  <center><img src="images/joke04012016.png" width="65%"></center>
  <p>
  We apologize again for subjecting you to so many changes over the years, and hope that this
  new, more consistent interface will find your approval.
  <p>
  In related news, we have also revised the interface for uploading custom tracks.  Rather than
  forcing you to wrestle with inconvenient file formats for your data or attempt to set up a web server,
  we now provide the option of loading your data from a deck of ISO 6586:1980 punch cards.  Simply
  punch your data onto a deck and mail the deck to us.  Our staff of highly trained specialists
  will take care of loading track, and will inform you by mail when the process is complete.  Please
  note that our current policy of expiring unused custom tracks remains in effect; you must visit
  your track within 72 hours of the postmark date.  Regrettably, decks cannot be returned.
  <p>
  Card decks may be addressed to:<br>
  UCSC Genome Informatics Group<br>
  Center for Biomolecular Science & Engineering<br>
  CBSE, 501D Engineering II Building<br>
  University of California, Santa Cruz<br>
  1156 High Street<br>
  Santa Cruz, CA 95064
  <p>
  This new file format is also an option for data output from the <a href="cgi-bin/hgTables">UCSC Table Browser</a>.
  Simply select "mail card deck" from the "output format" menu, and then enter your name and address on the subsequent
  page.  Please allow 4-6 weeks for delivery.
