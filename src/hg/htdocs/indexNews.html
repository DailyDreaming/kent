  <font color="#006666" size="4"><b>27 June 2016 - New Way to Share Sessions - Public Sessions!</b></font>
  <p>
  We are excited to announce the release of the
  <a href="cgi-bin/hgPublicSessions">Public Sessions</a>
  page, the newest way to share your UCSC Genome Browser snapshots with your colleagues
  and the world. The Public Sessions page collects sessions that users have elected to share 
  publicly. Sessions on this page can be filtered based on assembly, name, or a phrase from
  the description. Sessions can also be sorted based on their popularity or creation date.
  To add your own sessions to this Public Sessions page, just check the box under "post in
  public listing" on the session management page.
  </p>

  <p>
  The Genome Browser <a href="cgi-bin/hgSession">session management</a> page has also received an
  update with the release of the new Public Sessions page. Sessions are now arranged in a table,
  where varying numbers of sessions can be displayed on a page of this table. Sessions can now be
  filtered and ordered based on session name, primary assembly, and creation date. Clicking on the
  session name now displays that session in the Genome Browser. Session details, such as the name
  or the description, can be changed using the "details" button in the new table layout.
  </p>

  <p>
  The release of the new Public Sessions page also marks a change in our session expiration policy.
  We no longer expire sessions and associated custom tracks four months after their last use.
  Please note, however, that the UCSC Genome Browser is not a data storage service and that we
  encourage you to keep local copies of your session contents and custom track data.
  </p>

  <p>
  For more information about using sessions to share snapshots of the UCSC Genome Browser,
  please see the <a href="goldenPath/help/hgSessionHelp.html">User Guide</a> or our blog post,
  "<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/blog/how-to-share-your-ucsc-screenthoughts/"
  target="_blank">How to share your UCSC screenthoughts</a>."
  </p>

  <p>
  Thanks to Jonathan Casper and Matthew Speir for their work on this new tool.

  <font color="#006666" size="4"><b>15 June 2016 - New Official Asian Mirror Released</b></font>
  <p>
  We are pleased to announce the introduction of a new supported Genome Browser mirror 
  to serve our users in Asia. The genome-asia server 
  <a href="http://genome-asia.ucsc.edu" target="_blank">(http://genome-asia.ucsc.edu)</a>, 
  which is administered by UCSC, is physically located at the 
  <a href="http://www.yokohama.riken.jp/english/" target="_blank">RIKEN Yokohama Campus</a>
  in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
  Genome-asia is intended as an alternate, faster access point for those Browser users 
  who are geographically closer to Asia than to the western United States. The mirror 
  is functionally identical to the U.S.-based server, with one exception. Custom tracks 
  residing on the U.S. server are not automatically accessible from the genome-asia mirror; 
  therefore, the use of these custom tracks and saved sessions containing them will require 
  some manual intervention.
  </p>
  <p>
  Genome Browser users located in Asia will be automatically redirected to genome-asia 
  when they click the "Genomes" menu item on the Genome Browser home page, but will have 
  the option to remain on the U.S.-based server. In addition to the 
  genome-asia mirror, we continue to support a Europe-based Genome Browser mirror 
  <a href="http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu" target="_blank">(http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu)</a>
  in Bielefeld, Germany. A third-party mirror in 
  <a href="http://genome-mirror.moma.ki.au.dk/" target="_blank">Aarhus, Denmark</a>, 
  is available as an emergency backup in the rare event 
  that our three supported sites are offline.
  </p>
  <p>
  We wish to express our special thanks to Dr. Hideya Kawaji at the 
  <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/accc/" target="_blank">RIKEN Advanced 
  Center for Computing and Communication</a> for making this possible. We would also 
  like to acknowledge the following members of the UCSC Genome Browser team for their efforts: 
  Galt Barber, Robert Kuhn, Jorge Garcia, and Luvina Guruvadoo.
