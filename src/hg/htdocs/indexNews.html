		    UCSC is pleased to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the 
		    debut of the first assembled human genome sequence and its
		    then-fledgling visualization tool, the UCSC Genome Browser. 
		    Released on July 7, 2000, the genome sequence instantly 
		    created unprecedented web traffic on the
		    ucsc.edu domain as researchers around the world 
		    scrambled to download the data: 0.5 terabytes per day, a 
		    record that stood for many years.
		    <P>
		    David Haussler recounts that day: 
		    &quot;Seeing the waterfall of As, Gs, Cs, and Ts pouring 
		    off our server was an emotional moment. We were witnessing 
		    the product of more than three billion years of evolution, 
		    sequences passed down from the beginning of life to 
		    present-day humans.&quot; <sup>1</sup>
		    <P>
		    The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics group is proud of the role 
		    we have played in bringing the 
		    human genome, as well as the genomes of many other species, 
		    to the world.  We'd like to thank NHGRI, HHMI, and our other
		    funding agencies for making this service possible, and
		    also our many users and collaborators for their suggestions,
		    contributions, and support throughout the years.  We look 
		    forward to serving as a reliable 
		    source of bioinformatics tools and genomic annotations in 
		    the years to come while facing the exciting challenges 
		    presented by rapidly advancing technology.
		    <P>
		    To read more about UCSC's role in the race to assemble the 
		    first working draft of the human genome, including Jim 
		    Kent's remarkable programming feat that pulled it all
