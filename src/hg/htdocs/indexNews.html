		    <P>
		    We'd like to announce the release of a Genome Browser and 
		    Blat server for the marmoset genome (<em>Callithrix 
		    jacchus</em>). 
		    The June 2007 assembly -- WUSTL version Callithrix 
		    jacchus-2.0.2, UCSC version calJac1 -- was produced by 
		    Washington University St. Louis (WUSTL) School of Medicine 
		    Genome Sequencing Center in St. Louis, MO, USA. </P> 
		    <P>
		    <em>C. jacchus</em>, a member of the New World 
		    monkey clade, is the most widely studied marmoset. It is a
		    popular non-human primate model due to its small body size
		    and unique biological features, and has contributed to the 
		    study of brain function, immunity, reproductive biology and 
		    drug toxicity. <em>C. jacchus</em> marmosets typically give 
		    birth to twins that are somatic chimeras, i.e. each sibling 
		    is the mixture of sibling genotypes. (Excerpted from the 
		    WUSTL <em>C. jacchus</em>
		    <A HREF="http://genome.wustl.edu/genome.cgi?GENOME=Callithrix%20jacchus"
		    TARGET=_blank> project</A> page.) </P>
		    <P>
		    The <em>C. jacchus</em> genome was sequenced to 6X coverage 
		    using DNA from a female marmoset provided by the 
		    Southwestern
		    National Primate Research Center in San Antonio, TX, USA.
		    DNA from a full brother of the female was used as the source
		    for the CHORI-259 BAC library. This assembly is composed of 
		    49,724 supercontigs containing a total of approximately 
		    3.02 billion bases. For more statistics and details
		    on the assembly process, refer to the WUSTL 
		    Callithrix_jacchus-2.0.2

		    TARGET=_blank>assembly</A> page. </P>
		    <P>
		    Bulk downloads of the calJac1 sequence and annotations may 
		    be obtained from the Genome Browser 
		    <A HREF="ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/calJac1/"
		    TARGET=_blank>FTP server</A> or

		    <A HREF="http://genome.wustl.edu/pub/organism/Primates/Callithrix_jacchus/assembly/Callithrix_jacchus-2.0.2/"
		    TARGET=_blank>WUSTL</A>. See the WUSTL

		    Please acknowledge WUSTL School of Medicine Genome 
		    Sequencing Center in any publications that result from the 
		    use of this sequence assembly. </P>
		    <P>
		    We'd like to thank WUSTL School of Medicine Genome 
		    Sequencing Center for providing this assembly. The 
		    initial set of marmoset browser annotation tracks were 
		    generated by UCSC. The UCSC marmoset Genome Browser team is
		    Hiram Clawson, Robert Kuhn, Pauline Fujita, Brooke Rhead, 
		    and Donna Karolchik. See the
