		    <FONT FACE="courier" SIZE=3><B>22 Aug. 2007 - New Mouse Browser Released</B></FONT><BR>
		    <P>
		    The latest mouse genome assembly from the Mouse Genome
		    Sequencing Consortium, NCBI Build 37.1, is now available in 
		    the UCSC Genome Browser. This version (UCSC version mm9) is
		    considered to be essentially finished.
		    <P>
		    The Build 37 assembly includes approximately 2.6 Gb of
		    sequence on chromosomes 1-19, X, Y, M (mitochondrial DNA) 
		    and Un (unmapped clone contigs). 
		    For in-depth
		    information about this assembly,
		    see the 
		    <A http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/stats/BuildStats.cgi?taxid=10090&build=37&ver=1
                    TARGET=_blank>NCBI website</A>.
		    On chromosome Y in this assembly, only the short arm has 
		    reliable mapping data; therefore, most of the contigs on 
		    the Y chromosome are unplaced.
		    Note that the UCSC mm8 database contains only the 
		    reference strain C57BL/6J.</P>
                    <P>
                    The mm9 sequence and annotation data may be downloaded 
		    from the Genome Browser

                    We'd like to thank Deanna Church and the Mouse Genome

		    <FONT FACE="courier" SIZE=3><B>22 Aug. 2007 - Latest Bovine Assembly Available</B></FONT><BR>
		    <P>
		    The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group has released a 
		    Genome Browser and Blat server for the Aug. 2006 Btau_3.1
		    draft assembly of the cow genome. This assembly (UCSC
		    version bosTau3) was provided by Baylor
		    College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center in
		    Houston, TX.
		    <P>
		    The Btau_3.1 release was produced by the Atlas genome 
		    assembly system at Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome 
		    Sequencing Center. The  sequencing strategy combined BAC 
		    shotgun reads with whole genome shotgun reads from small 
		    insert libraries as well as BAC end sequences. The assembly 
		    contains chromosomes 1-29 and X as well as 13045 scaffolds 
		    (named chrUn.003.*). 
		    More information on the Btau_3.1 assembly can be found on
		    the Baylor 
		    <A HREF="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/bovine/"
		    TARGET=_blank>Bovine Genome Project</A> web page and the
		    <A HREF="ftp://ftp.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/pub/data/Btaurus/fasta/Btau20060815-freeze/ReadMeBovine.3.1.txt" 
		    TARGET=_blank>Readme</A> file that accompanies this release.
		    </P>
		    <P>
		    Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotation data are 
		    available via the Genome Browser 
		    <A HREF="ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/bosTau3/">FTP server</A> or 
		    <A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#cow">Downloads</A>

		    <A HREF="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/conditions_for_use.html" 
		    TARGET=_blank>conditions of use</A> regarding these
		    data. The bosTau3 annotation tracks were generated by 
		    UCSC and collaborators worldwide. 
		    <P>
		    We'd like to thank Baylor College of Medicine for 
		    the bovine sequence and assembly. We'd also like to 
		    acknowledge the members of the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics
		    Group who contributed to the Cow Genome Browser:

		    <FONT FACE="courier" SIZE=3><B>2 Aug. 2007 - Five New Worm Assemblies: </B></FONT>
		    We've updated our existing nematode browsers--for <em>C. 
		    elegans</em> and <em>C. briggsae</em>--to the latest 
		    publicly available assemblies. In addition, we've added
		    three new worms to our collection: <em>C. brenneri</em> 
		    (Caenorhabditis n. sp. PB2801), <em>C. remanei</em>,
		    and <em>Pristionchus pacificus</em>.
