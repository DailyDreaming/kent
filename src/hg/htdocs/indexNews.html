		    <P>
		    Several of the common display and navigation operations 
		    offered on the Genome Browser tracks page may now be quickly
		    accessed by right-clicking on a feature on the tracks image 
		    and selecting an option from the displayed menu. Depending 
		    on context, the right-click feature will let you 
		    change the track display mode, zoom in or out to the exact 
		    position coordinates of the feature, open the &quot;Get 
		    DNA&quot; window at the feature's coordinates, display 
		    details about the feature, open a popup window to configure 
		    the track's display, or display the entire tracks image in 
		    a separate window for inclusion in spreadsheets or other 
		    documents. (Note that the &quot;PDF/PS&quot; option in the 
		    Genome Browser top navigation bar can also be used to 
		    generate a high-quality annotation tracks image suitable 
		    for printing.)

                    alt="Right-click screenshot">
		    <BR>
		    <P>
		    To use the right-click feature, make sure the &quot;Enable 
		    advanced javascript features&quot; option on the 
		    <A
HREF="../cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgTracksConfigPage=configure+tracks+and+display">tracks 
		    configuration page</A> is checked, and configure your 
		    internet browser to allow the display of popup windows from 
		    <em>genome.ucsc.edu</em>. When enabled, the right-click 
		    navigation feature replaces the default contextual menu 
		    typically displayed by your internet browser when you 
		    right-click on the tracks image. A few combinations of the 
		    Mozilla Firefox browser on Mac OS do not support the 
		    right-click menu functionality using secondary click; in 
		    these instances, you must use the explicit ctrl-click action
		    to display the menu. 
		    <P>
	 	    Credit goes to Larry Meyer and Brooke Rhead for doing the
		    lion's share of the design, development and testing of this 
		    feature, with engineering support from Tim Dreszer and 
		    additional testing by several others on the QA team.

Searching for Tracks Just Got Easier!</B></FONT>
		    <P>
		    The number of genome assemblies and annotation
		    tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser has increased 
		    exponentially over the past few years. Along with this 
		    growth, it has become more difficult for browser users to 
		    sort through the many tracks to find the data they're 
		    interested in.
		    <P>
		    With our latest Genome Browser release, we've introduced a 
		    new track search feature that will help you to quickly and 
		    easily find and display specific annotation data sets. The 
		    search feature is available via the "track search" button 
		    on the browser gateway and tracks display pages.

                    <P>
		    It is now possible to rearrange the order that tracks appear
		    in the browser image directly from the browser image itself.
		    To reorder tracks, click-and-hold the side label or gray 
		    mini-button of a single track and drag the highlighted track
		    to a new position within the image.
