# gbMembers.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated gbMembers.c and gbMembers.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

# This sql was hacked to insert the datetime object, autoSql could not
# do that and added auto_increment to the idx field and index with userName


#UCSC Genome Browser members
