AUTOXML OVERVIEW

AutoXML generates C code for an XML parser given
a XML DTD file.   It will generate a structure
for each 'element' in the DTD,  and populate the
structure with fields for each attribute of the structure.
By default it will generate a parser that ignores
elements and attributes not in the DTD, but otherwise
is a 'validating' parser.  If you use the -picky
flag it will be fully validating.   

The AutoXML parser will load the entire file into
memory.   If this is a problem you'll have to resort
to the lower level 'xap' parser, which is much like
the commonly used 'expat' parser, but a bit faster.

A SHORT XML AND DTD TUTORIAL

If you find yourself befuddled by all the acronyms
so far you're probably new to XML.   Here's a brief
description.   XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language.
It's a tag-based format.   A simple example of
an XML doc might be:
   <POLYGON id="square">
       <DESCRIPTION>This soooo square man</DESCRIPTION>
       <POINT x="0" y="0" ->
       <POINT x="0" y="1" ->
       <POINT x="1" y="1" ->
       <POINT x="1" y="0" ->
   </POLYGON>
Everything in XML lives between <TAG></TAG> pairs.  
A tag may have associated text, attributes and subtags.  
In the example above POLYGON has the subtags DESCRIPTION 
and POINT, the attribute id, and no text.  DESCRIPTON has 
the text"This is soooo square man" and no subtags or
attributes.   POINT has the attributes x and y.  POINT
also illustrates a little XML shortcut - tags containing
only attributes can be written <TAG att="something" ->
as a shortcut for <TAG att="something"></TAG>.  

XML is much like HTML, but has significant differences as
well.  All attributes must be enclosed in quotes in XML,
while quotes are optional in HTML.   Tags must strictly
nest in XML, while HTML allows tags to be opened but not
closed.  The tags in HTML are predefined.   In XML the
definition of tags is up to you.

Tags can be defined two ways in XML - by a DTD file or
by and XML schema.  There are pros and cons of each
method.  DTD files are relatively simple, and are recognized
by a wide variety of parsers and XML browsers.  On the
other hand DTD files can't express that a certain attribute
has to be numerical.   XML schemas are more complex.  They
are themselves written in a type of XML, which is nice in
some ways.  They are not as widely supported yet.  Currently
autoXml only works with DTD files with some modest extensions.

Here is an DTD file which would describe the POLYGON format
above:

<!ELEMENT POLYGON (DESCRIPTION? POINT+)>
<!ATTLIST POLYGON id CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!ELEMENT DESCRIPTION (#PCDATA)>

<!ELEMENT POINT>
<!ATTLIST POINT x CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST POINT y CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST POINT z CDATA "0">

The DTD has two major types of definitions - ELEMENTs and ATTLISTs
(or attributes).  An element definition includes the name of
the element and an optional parethesized list of subelements.
The subelements must be defined elsewhere in the DTD with the
exception of the #PCDATA subelement, which is used to indicate
that the element can have text between it's tags.   Each subelement
may be followed by one of the following characters:
    ? - the subelement is optional
    + - the subelement occurs at least once
    * - the subelement occurs 0 or more times
if there is no following character the subelement occurs exactly
once.

The ATTLIST defines an attribute and associates it with an element.
Though an ATTLIST need not follow the element it is associated
with directly, it is good style to keep ATTLISTs together with
their ELEMENT.  Here are the fields in an ATTLIST:
    element - name of element this is associated with
    name - name of this attribute
    type - generally CDATA.  Can be a reference or date, but these
           are not supported by autoXml.
    default - this contains a default value to be used if the attribute
           is not present.   The keyword #REQUIRED in this field means
	   that the attribute must be present.  The keyword #IMPLIED
	   means that it's ok for this attribute to be missing (in which
	   case it will have a NULL or zero value after read by autoXML).

AUTOXML EXTENSIONS AND LIMITS

AutoXml extends the type field of ATTLIST to include INT or FLOAT for
numerical rather than string values.  If you include these extensions
please use the .dtdx rather than .dtd suffix on your dtd file.

Currently AutoXML can't cope with dtd comments, and expects
all ELEMENTS and ATTLIST declarations to fit on a line.  It doesn't
handle reference or data types either.


AUTOXML CODE GENERATION

The polygon.dtdx file here:

<!ELEMENT POLYGON (DESCRIPTION? POINT+)>
<!ATTLIST POLYGON id CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ELEMENT DESCRIPTION (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT POINT>
<!ATTLIST POINT x INT #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST POINT y INT #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST POINT z INT "0">

And the command line:
   autoXml polygon.dtdx poly

Generates poly.h as follows

/* poly.h autoXml generated file */
#ifndef POLY_H
#define POLY_H

struct polyPolygon
    {
    struct polyPolygon *next;
    char *id;	/* Required */
    struct polyDescription *polyDescription;	/** Optional (may be NULL). **/
    struct polyPoint *polyPoint;	/** Non-empty list required. **/
    };

void polyPolygonSave(struct polyPolygon *obj, int indent, FILE *f);
/* Save polyPolygon to file. */

struct polyPolygon *polyPolygonLoad(char *fileName);
/* Load polyPolygon from file. */

struct polyDescription
    {
    struct polyDescription *next;
    char *text;
    };

void polyDescriptionSave(struct polyDescription *obj, int indent, FILE *f);
/* Save polyDescription to file. */

struct polyDescription *polyDescriptionLoad(char *fileName);
/* Load polyDescription from file. */

struct polyPoint
    {
    struct polyPoint *next;
    double x;	/* Required */
    double y;	/* Required */
    double z;	/* Defaults to 0 */
    };

void polyPointSave(struct polyPoint *obj, int indent, FILE *f);
/* Save polyPoint to file. */

struct polyPoint *polyPointLoad(char *fileName);
/* Load polyPoint from file. */

#endif /* POLY_H */

It generates a corresponding .c file as well.  Each XML file has
to have a root object.  In this case the root object is POLYGON
(our DTD as is won't let us have more than one polygon per file).
You can read an XML file that respects this DTD using the 
polyPolygonLoad() function,  and save it back out using the
polyPolygonSave.
