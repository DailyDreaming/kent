hgNetDist is a loader utility that takes
interaction or other data and creates a 
distance for each pair of genes in the set.

Use code from genering to read the data,
create the network, and then add more
code to do the breadth-first search
to calc the dist.  (Can add Dijkstra and 
Floyd-Warshall later as needed for weights)

May need to create a sgdP2P.as? 
Or some generic stand-in?

Given the interaction format:
genex geney numrepetitions

and there is a header of one line
(probably the code in the genering or its notes
takes care of this? -  or was it a mysql import?

Of course, I could just read it straight
and do the deed from the input file directly.

The output would still be a table.

This will be a fun Sunday project.
