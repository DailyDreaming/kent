<H3>Description</H3>
This column shows the score form txCdsPredict program. This
program weighs a variety of evidence including the presence of a Kozak consensus
sequence at the start codon, the length of the ORF, the presense of upstream
ORFs, homology in other species, and nonsense mediated decay.  In general
a score over 1000 is almost certain to be a protein, and scores over 800 have
about a 90% chance of being a protein.

The txCdsPredict program is part of the UCSC Genes pipeline described in brief
