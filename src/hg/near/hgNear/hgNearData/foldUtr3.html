<H3>Description</H3>
This column shows the estimated energy in kcal/mol of
folding the 5' UTR of a gene into the best predicted
secondary structure.

<H3>Methods</H3>
The energy calculations and secondary structure predictions
are from the RNAfold program, which is part of the
<A HREF="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/">Vienna RNA Package</A>.
