<H2>Description</H2>
This column shows the predicted transcription factor binding
sites that regulate the expression of the gene.
<H2>Methods</H2>
This analysis was performed according to 
<A HREF="http://cs.stanford.edu/~eran/publications/segal_promoters.pdf">
Genome-wide discovery of transcriptional modules from DNA sequence and gene
expression</A> on various pre-existing microarray datasets.
A regulatory module is comprised of a set of genes predicted to be regulated by the same
combination of DNA sequence motifs. The predictions are based on the
co-expression of the set of genes in the module and on the appearance of
common combinations of motifs in the upstream regions of genes assigned to
the same module.
