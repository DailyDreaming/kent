This column displays all the 
<A HREF="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/" TARGET=_blank>Protein Data Bank (PDB)</A> 
ID's associated with a gene.
PDB is a database of proteins with known 3-D structures.  
In some cases these records will only correspond to only a fragment of the
gene.  In other cases the PDB record may include other molecules the protein
interacts with.  

<H3>Action</H3>
Click on the PDB ID to display the associated PDB Structure Explorer page.

<H3>Methods</H3>
The PDB ID's are extracted from SwissProt.
