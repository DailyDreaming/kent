<H2>Description</H2>
This column shows the predicted regulatory module (combination
of transcription factor binding sites) that regulate the gene.
<H2>Methods</H2>
This analysis was performed according to 
<A HREF="http://cs.stanford.edu/~eran/publications/segal_promoters.pdf">
Genome-wide discovery of transcriptional modules from DNA sequence and gene
expression</A> on various pre-existing microarray datasets.
A regulatory module is comprised of a set of genes predicted to be regulated by the same
combination of DNA sequence motifs. The predictions are based on the
co-expression of the set of genes in the module and on the appearance of
common combinations of motifs in the upstream regions of genes assigned to
the same module. For each module, you can view the set of genes that belong
to it, the combination of motifs that play a role in controlling the
expression of the module genes, the profiles of each of the individual
motifs, and the specific locations of the motif appearances within the
promoter of each of the genes in the module.
