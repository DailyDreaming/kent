<H3>Description</H3>
This column shows the percentage identity at the protein level
between this gene and the selected gene.
<H3>Method</H3>
All known splice variants of all known $organism genes are
put into a BLAST protein database with the formatdb command.
Then this database is searched with each known gene using
version 2.2.5 of the NCBI blastall command with the following
flags:
 -p blastp -e 0.01 -m 8 -b 1000
which tell the program to do a protein based search and report
up to 1000 hits of e-value 0.01 or better in a tab delimited
format.  The output of this is loaded into our database.
