<H3>Description</H3>
This column shows the category of a gene.  Possible categories include
coding, noncoding, antisense or nearCoding. A coding transcript is one where 
the evidence is relatively good that it produces a protein. The nearCoding 
transcripts overlap coding transcripts by at least 20 bases on the same strand, 
but themselves do not seem to produce protein products. In many cases this is 
because they are splicing variants with introns after the stop codon, that 
therefore undergo nonsense mediated decay. Antisense transcripts overlap 
coding transcripts by at least 20 bases on the oppposite strand. The other 
transcripts, which are neither coding, nor overlapping coding, are categorized 
as noncoding.
