<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This column shows the Affymetrix ID from the HG-U95 chip
that best corresponds best to each gene.</P>

<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>Target genome sequences were downloaded from the
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/download_center.affx" TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix Download Center</A>
and mapped to the genome using Blat followed by PslReps with the parameters
-minCover=0.85 -minAli=0.95. For each gene, the most overlapping target (on 
the same strand and excluding introns) was chosen.
