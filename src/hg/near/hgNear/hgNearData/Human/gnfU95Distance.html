<H3>Description</H3>
This column shows the similarity of the expression of each gene 
to the selected gene. Genes with identical expression profiles show a value of 0.
This column shows data only for the 1000 genes (including
splicing variants) that have the most similar expression
profiles.

<H3>Methods</H3>
The expression distance between two genes is a weighted
sum computed with the following formula:
<PRE>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delta(a,b) = sum(w[i] * |a[i] - b[i]| ) / sum(w[i])
</PRE>
where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are expression vectors associated with the two
genes indexed by tissue, <em>w</em> is an array of weights, and the
sums are taken over all tissues.  When there are multiple replicants for
a tissue the median value is used.  The values for the weights
are 0.1 for the cancer cell lines and 0.5 for the brain and nervous
system derived tissues (since these are overrepresented).  The weights
for the ovary-derived tissues are 0.5 for the one labeled 'ovary' and
0.25 each for the OVR278E and OVR278S.  The other tissues are all weighted
1.0.
