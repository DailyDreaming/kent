<H3>Description</H3>
This column shows how similar the GNF expression data for of
the gene to data for the selected gene.  Genes with identical
expression profiles will have a 0 in this column.
This column only has data for the 1000 genes (including
splicing variants) that have the most similar expression
profiles.
<H3>Method</H3>
The expression distance between two genes is a weighted
sum computed with the following formula:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delta(a,b) = sum(w[i] * |a[i] - b[i]| ) / sum(w[i])<BR>
where a and b are expression vectors associated with the two
genes indexed by tissue,  w is an array of weights, and the
sums are taken over all tissues.  The values for the weights
are currently all 1.0.
