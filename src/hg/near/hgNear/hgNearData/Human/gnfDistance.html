<H3>Description</H3>
This column shows the similarity of the expression of each gene 
to the selected gene. Genes with identical
expression profiles show a value of 0.
This column shows data only for the 1000 genes (including
splicing variants) that have the most similar expression
profiles.

<H3>Method</H3>
The expression distance between two genes is a weighted
sum computed with the following formula:
<PRE>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delta(a,b) = sum(w[i] * |a[i] - b[i]| ) / sum(w[i])<BR>
where a and b are expression vectors associated with the two
genes indexed by tissue,  w is an array of weights, and the
sums are taken over all tissues.  Currently, all weights have a value
of 1.0.
