<H3>Description</H3>
<P>
This column shows the ID of the probe in the GNF Atlas 2 which overlaps most with gene 
from the from the Human Gene Expression.  The GNF Altas 2 is based on two
Affymetrix chips, the U133A, and a custom-designed GNF1H chip.  

<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>Target sequences for U133A were downloaded from the
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/download_center.affx" TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix 
Download Center</A>.  Target sequences for GNF1H were obtained from GNF via email.
The sequences and mapped to the genome using <TT>blat</TT> followed by <TT>pslReps</TT> 
with the parameters -minCover=0.85 -minAli=0.95. For each gene, the most overlapping 
target (on the same strand and excluding introns) was chosen.
