<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This track displays selected data from the GNF Expression Atlas on the 
Affymetrix U95 chip.  It shows the ratio of expression of a gene in 
<A HREF="http://expression.gnf.org/human_annot.html">specific tissues</A>
to expression of the gene overall. By default, a gene that is
more highly expressed in a tissue is colored red, and a less expressed gene
is shown in green. This coloring is standard, but is the opposite of what 
a naive user might expect: in this case, red means go, and green means stop!  
<P>
Color-blind users can switch the coloring from red/green to yellow/blue via
the <em>configure</em> button.
