<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This column shows data from the GNF Expression Atlas on the Affymetrix U95 chip.
It shows the expression of genes in
<A HREF="http://expression.gnf.org/human_annot.html">specific tissues</A>.
This track can be configured a number of ways. </P>
<P>The track initially shows the ratio of expression in a specific tissue 
to expression of the gene overall.  By default if a gene is more highly expressed 
in a tissue it will be colored red, and if it is less expressed in the tissue it 
will be green.  This coloring is standard, but the opposite of what a naive user 
might think.  In this case red means go, and green means stop!  Color blind users can
switch from red/green to yellow/blue coloring in the configuration page. The track
can also be configured to show absolute expression values as shades of gray with
higher expression levels shown in lighter shades.   Both the ratio and absolute
expressions are colored on a logarithmic scale.</P>
<P>The 'tissue' drop-down in the configuration page controls the level of detail
displayed. If 'all replicas' is selected then the value of each individual experimental
relica of each tissue is shown.  If median of replicas is selected then just a single
value for each tissue is shown.  The default 'selected' mode just shows median values
for selected tissues.</P>

<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>For detailed information about the experiments, see Su et al., 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11904358&dopt=Abstract"

<I>PNAS</I>, Mar 19, 2002. </P>
<P>When calculating expression ratios, the overall expression level in the
denominator is calculated by first taking the median of replicants for
each non-cancerous tissue,  and then taking the median of these medians.
