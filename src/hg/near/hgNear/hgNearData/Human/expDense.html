<H3>Description</H3>
This column shows the ratio of expression of a gene in a particular
tissue to the expression of the gene overall. By default, a gene that is
more highly expressed in a tissue is colored red, and a less expressed gene
is shown in green. This coloring is standard, but is the opposite of what 
a naive user might expect: in this case, red means go, and green means stop!  
<P>
Color-blind users can switch the coloring from red/green to yellow/blue via
the <em>configure</em> button.

<H3>Methods</H3>
These data will soon be described in a paper that has not yet been published.

The data for this column were kindly provided by Allen Day at the Stan Nelson 
lab at UCLA.
