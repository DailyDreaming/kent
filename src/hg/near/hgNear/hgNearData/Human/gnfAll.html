<H3>Description</H3>
This column displays all data from the GNF Gene Expression Atlas on the Affymetrix 
U95 chip, showing the ratio of expression of a gene in 
<A HREF="http://expression.gnf.org/human_annot.html">specific tissues</A>
to expression of the gene overall.  
<P>
A gene that is more highly 
expressed in a tissue is colored red, and a less expressed gene is shown in 
green. The values are colored on a logarithmic scale. This coloring is standard, 
but is the opposite of what a naive user 
might expect: in this case, red means go and green means stop!  
Black indicates that a gene is neither over nor under expressed in the tissue. 
Uncolored boxes (white on most browsers) represent missing data.  
<H3>Column Configuration</H3>
<UL>
<LI>
Absolute expression values: The display can be configured to show 
absolute expression values rather than ratio values. To toggle the display, 
select the <em>absolute</em> option from the <em>values</em> pulldown menu on 
the Configuration page. Absolute expression values
are shown in shades of gray, with higher expression levels shown in lighter 
shades. As with ratio values, absolute values are colored on a logarithmic 
scale.
<LI>Color scheme: Color blind users can switch the coloring scheme from red/green to yellow/blue 
via the <em>Expression ratio colors</em> pulldown menu on the Configuration page.
<LI>Level of tissue detail: The <em>tissue</em> pulldown menu on the Configuration
page controls the amount and type of tissue data displayed. By default, only the 
median values for selected tissues are shown.  To display the value of all 
individual experimental replicas of all tissues, 
select the <em>all replicas</em> option. To view a single median value for each 
tissue, choose the <em>median of replicas</em> option.

<H3>Methods</H3>
For detailed information about the experiments, see Su et al., 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11904358&dopt=Abstract"
TARGET=_blank>"Large-scale analysis of the human and mouse transcriptomes."</A>, 
<I>PNAS</I>, Mar 19, 2002. 
<P>When calculating expression ratios, the overall expression level in the
denominator was calculated by first taking the median of replicants for
each non-cancerous tissue, and then taking the median of these medians.
