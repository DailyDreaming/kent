<H3>Description</H3>
This column shows all data from the GNF Expression Atlas on the Affymetrix U95 chip.
It shows the ratio of expression of a gene in 
<A HREF="http://expression.gnf.org/human_annot.html">specific tissues</A>
to expression of the gene overall.  By default if a gene is
more highly expressed in a tissue it will be colored red, and if it is
less expressed in the tissue it will be green.  This coloring is standard,
but the opposite of what a naive user might think.  In this case red
means go, and green means stop!  Color blind users can
switch from red/green to yellow/blue coloring in the configuration page.</P>
Black means a gene is neither over nor under expressed in the tissue. Uncolored
boxes (white on most browsers) represent missing data.
