<P>This shows the maximum absolute expression level for any tissue.
The numbers here range up to 52,000 but all except a few outliers are
below 30,000.  A number less than 20 here indicates that expression
could not be detected in any tissue at levels significantly above the 
cross-hybridization controls.  </P>
