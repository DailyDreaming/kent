<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This track the Affymetrix ID from the U74 series of chips (A, B, and C)
that corresponds best to this gene</P>

<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>Target genome sequences were downloaded from the
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/download_center.affx">Affymetrix Download Center</A>
and mapped to the genome using blat followed by pslReps with the parameters
-minCover=0.85 -minAli=0.95.  For each gene the most overlapping target (on the same strand 
and excluding introns) is chosen.
