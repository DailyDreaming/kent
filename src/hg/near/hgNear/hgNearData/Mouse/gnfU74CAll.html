<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This column displays all data from the Mouse GNF Expression Atlas on the
Affymetrix Mouse U74C chip.  The data shows the ratio of 
expression of each gene in selected tissues to the expression of the gene 
overall.  
<P>
By default, a gene that is more highly expressed in a tissue is 
colored red, and a less expressed gene is shown in green. This coloring is 
standard, but is the opposite of what 
a naive user might expect: in this case, red means go, and green means stop!  
Black means a gene is neither over nor under expressed in the tissue. Uncolored
boxes (white on most browsers) represent missing data.
<P>
Color-blind users can switch the coloring from red/green to blue/green via
the <em>configure</em> button.
