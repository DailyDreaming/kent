<H3>Description</H3>
This track shows the GNF Expression Atlas ratio of expression of a gene in selected
tissues to expression of the gene overall.  By default if a gene is
more highly expressed in a tissue it will be colored red, and if it is
less expressed in the tissue it will be green.  This coloring is standard,
but the opposite of what a naive user might think.  In this case red
means go, and green means stop!  Color blind users can
switch from red/green to blue/green coloring in the configuration page.</P>
