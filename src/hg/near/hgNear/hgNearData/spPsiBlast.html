<H3>Description</H3>
<p>
This column shows the <tt>PSI-BLAST</tt> e-value (expectation value) between a
SwissProt or TrEMBL protein associated with the gene and one associated with
the selected gene. The greater the similarity of two proteins, the lower the
e-value is.  Identical long proteins have an e-value of 0.
</p>

<H3>Method</H3>
<p>
PSI-BLAST was run on the $organism proteins from the
SwissProt and TrEMBL databases of 15 November 2004
in an all-versus-all fashion using the following flags:</p>

<pre>
    -j 5  -e 1000 -v 1000 -b 0
</pre>
These flags tell the program to do a maximum of 5 iterations and
output a maximum of 1000 hits at at e-values up to 1000.

<p>Each protein is mapped to its associated Known Genes.  Proteins that cannot 
be mapped are dropped.  For each of the remaining pairs of aligned proteins,
the best e-value is under 10.0 is kept.
</p>

<H3>Action</H3>
<p>
Click on a gene's E-value to display an alignment between the gene and the 
selected (highlighted) gene.
