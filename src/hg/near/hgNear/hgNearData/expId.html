<H3>Description</H3>
This track shows the Affymetrix ID of the expression data associated with 
this gene.  
<H3>Methods</H3>
Spots on Affymetrix chip are designed to probe expression
levels of a particular UniGene cluster.  A representative
EST from each cluster is mapped to the genome with BLAT.
The cluster which shares the most genomic bases (on the same
strand) as the known gene is used to provide expression data
for that gene.
