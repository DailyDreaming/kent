<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This column shows the ratio of expression of each gene in a particular phase
of the worm life cycle to the expression of the gene in mixed wild-type N2
cultures.  These experiments were replicated several times.  This track
shows just a representative replication.</P>
<P>
A gene that is more highly 
expressed is colored red, and a less expressed gene is shown in 
green. The values are colored on a logarithmic scale. This coloring is standard, 
but is the opposite of what a naive user 
might expect: in this case, red means go and green means stop!  
Black indicates that a gene is neither over nor under expressed. 
Uncolored boxes (white on most browsers) represent missing data.  
<P>
Color blind users can switch the coloring scheme from red/green to yellow/blue 
via the <em>Expression ratio colors</em> pulldown menu on the Configuration page.

<H3>Methods</H3>
The data in this column were collected as described in the paper
Jiang M, et.al. (2001), 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11134517&dopt=Abstract" TARGET=_blank>"Genome-wide analysis of 
developmental and sex-regulated gene expression profiles in 
Caenorhabditis elegans"</A>, <em>PNAS</em> 98(1):218-23. 
We retrieved the data from the
<A HREF="http://genome-www5.stanford.edu/" TARGET=_blank>Stanford Microarray 
Database</A>.
