<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This column shows the ratio of expression of each gene in a particular phase
of the worm life cycle to expression of the gene in mixed wild-type N2
cultures. These experiments were replicated several times.  This track
shows just a representative replication.</P>
<P>
By default, a gene that is more highly expressed in a tissue is 
colored red, and a less expressed gene is shown in green. This coloring is 
standard, but is the opposite of what 
a naive user might expect: in this case, red means go, and green means stop!  
<P>
Color-blind users can switch the coloring from red/green to blue/green via
the <em>configure</em> button.

<H3>Methods</H3>
The data in this column were collected as described in the paper
Jiang M, et.al. (2001),
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11134517&dopt=Abstract" TARGET=_blank>"Genome-wide analysis of 
developmental and sex-regulated gene expression profiles in 
Caenorhabditis elegans"</A>, <em>PNAS</em> 98(1):218-23. 
We retrieved the data from the
<A HREF="http://genome-www5.stanford.edu/" TARGET=_blank>Stanford Microarray 
Database</A>.
