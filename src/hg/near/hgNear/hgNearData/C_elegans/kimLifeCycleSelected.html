<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This track shows the ratio of expression of a gene in a particular phase
of the worm life cycle to expression of a gene in mixed wild-type N2
cultures.  These experiments were replicated several time.  This track
just shows a representative replication.</P>
<P>By default if a gene is more highly expressed in a particular
phase it will be colored red, and if it is
less expressed in the tissue it will be green.  This coloring is standard,
but the opposite of what a naive user might think.  In this case red
means go, and green means stop!  Color blind users can
switch from red/green to blue/green coloring in the configuration page.

<H3>Methods</H3>
The data in this column was collected as described in the PNAS paper
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11134517&dopt=Abstract">Genome-wide analysis of developmental and 
sex-regulated gene expression profiles in Caenorhabditis elegans</A>. We
retrieved the data from 
<A HREF="http://genome-www5.stanford.edu/">The Stanford Microarray Database</A>.
