<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This column shows the ratio of expression of each gene in a particular phase
of the fly life cycle to the expression of the gene in ?? 
cultures.  The experiments were replicated two times each.  This track
shows just a representative replication.</P>
<P>
Black means a gene is neither over nor under expressed in the tissue. Uncolored
boxes (white on most browsers) represent missing data.
Color-blind users can switch the coloring from red/green to blue/green via
the <em>configure</em> button.

<H3>Methods</H3>
The data in this column were collected as described in the paper
Arbeitman MN, et al. (2002), 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12351791&dopt=Abstract" TARGET=_blank>
"Gene expression during the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster"</A>, 
<em>Science</em> 2002 Sep 27;297(5590):2270-5.
We retrieved the data from the

Database</A>.
