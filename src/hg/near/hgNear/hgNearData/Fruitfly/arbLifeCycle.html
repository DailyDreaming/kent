<H3>Description</H3>

<P>This column shows the expression of genes in various phases 
of the fly life cycle.  The experiments were replicated two times each.  
This track can be configured a number of ways. </P>

<P>The track initially shows the ratio of expression at a specific
life cycle stage to expression of the gene in mixed egg-to-adult
cultures.  By default if a gene is more highly expressed in a life
cycle stage it will be colored red, and if it is less expressed in
that stage it will be green.  This coloring is standard, but the
opposite of what a naive user might think.  In this case red means go,
and green means stop!  Black means a gene is neither over nor under
expressed in the life cycle stage. Uncolored boxes (white on most
browsers) represent missing data.  Color blind users can switch from
red/green to yellow/blue coloring in the configuration page. The track
can also be configured to show absolute expression values as shades of
gray with higher expression levels shown in lighter shades.  Both the
ratio and absolute expressions are colored on a logarithmic scale.</P>

<P>The 'tissue' drop-down in the configuration page controls the level
of detail displayed. If 'all replicas' is selected then the value of
each individual experimental replica of each life cycle stage is
shown.  If median of replicas is selected then just a single value for
each life cycle stage is shown.  The default 'selected' mode just
shows median values for selected stages.</P>
