<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This column shows the ratio of expression of each gene in a particular phase
of the fly life cycle to the expression of the gene in ?? 
cultures.  The experiments were replicated two times each.  This column
shows the median value for each life cycle stage.</P>
<P>
A gene that is more highly 
expressed in a tissue is colored red, and a less expressed gene is shown in 
green. The values are colored on a logarithmic scale. This coloring is standard, 
but is the opposite of what a naive user 
might expect: in this case, red means go and green means stop!  
Black indicates that a gene is neither over nor under expressed in the tissue. 
Uncolored boxes (white on most browsers) represent missing data.  
<P>
Color blind users can switch the coloring scheme from red/green to yellow/blue 
via the <em>Expression ratio colors</em> pulldown menu on the Configuration page.

<H3>Methods</H3>
The data in this column were collected as described in the paper
Arbeitman MN, et al. (2002), 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12351791&dopt=Abstract" TARGET=_blank>
"Gene expression during the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster"</A>, 
<em>Science</em> 2002 Sep 27;297(5590):2270-5.
We retrieved the data from the
