<H3>Description</H3>
This column shows the BLASTP e-value between this gene and the
selected gene.  The more similar two proteins are the lower the
e-value will be.  Identical proteins have an e-value of 0.
E-value is short for 'expectation value.' Formally an e-value
is the number of other known genes that would be expected to have
at least this level of homology by chance.  An E-value less than 0.1 can
be safely interpreted as the probability that a match this good would
occur merely by chance.

<H3>Method</H3>
All known splice variants of all known $organism genes are
put into a BLAST protein database with the formatdb command.
Then this database is searched with each known gene using
version 2.2.5 of the NCBI blastall command with the following
flags:
 -p blastp -e 0.01 -m 8 -b 1000
which tell the program to do a protein based search and report
up to 1000 hits of e-value 0.01 or better in a tab delimited
format.  The output of this is loaded into our database.
