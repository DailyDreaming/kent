<H3>Description</H3>
This shows the <A HREF="www.ensembl.org">Ensembl</A> transcript ID associated with this 
gene.  Ensembl is an automatic gene prediction pipeline and a major genome database
and web site run by with the Sanger Institute and The European Bioinformatics Institute.
Ensembl is especially effective at capturing genes that are known in one organism
to another organism.  Compared to other gene predictions they tend to have high
specificity but low sensitivity to genes not already associated with characterized
mrna or protein sequence.
