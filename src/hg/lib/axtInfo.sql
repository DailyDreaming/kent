# axtInfo.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated axtInfo.c and axtInfo.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Axt alignment names and sizes
CREATE TABLE axtInfo (
    chrom varchar(255) not null,	# chromosome name
    size int unsigned not null,	# Chromosome size
    fileName varchar(255) not null,	# axt  file name 
              #Indices
    PRIMARY KEY(chrom)
);
