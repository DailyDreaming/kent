All comments:
 Activates tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases in the presence of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and strongly activates protein kinase C. Is probably a multifunctional regulator of the cell signaling processes mediated by both kinases. Activates the ADP-ribosyltransferase (exoS) activity of bacterial origin.
 Homodimer. Interacts with PCTK1 (By similarity).
 Cytoplasmic.
 14-3-3 proteins are localized in neurons, and are axonally transported to the nerve terminals. They may be also present, at lower levels, in various other eukaryotic tissues.
 Isoform delta differs from isoform zeta in being phosphorylated (By similarity).
 Belongs to the 14-3-3 family.
