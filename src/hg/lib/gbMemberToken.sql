# gbMemberToken.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated gbMemberToken.c and gbMemberToken.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Maps random token to values of gbMembers.userName
CREATE TABLE gbMemberToken (
    token int unsigned not null,	# Random nonzero number
    userName varchar(255) not null,	# Name used to login in hgLogin
    createTime varchar(255) not null,	# Date and time at which token was created
              #Indices
    PRIMARY KEY(token)
