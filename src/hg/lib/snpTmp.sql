# snpTmp.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated snpTmp.c and snpTmp.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Polymorphism data subset used during processing
CREATE TABLE snpTmp (
    chrom varchar(255) not null,	# Chromosome
    chromStart int unsigned not null,	# Start position in chrom
    chromEnd int unsigned not null,	# End position in chrom
    name varchar(255) not null,	# Reference SNP identifier or Affy SNP name
    strand char(1) not null,	# Which DNA strand contains the observed alleles
    refNCBI longblob not null,	# Reference genomic from dbSNP
    locType varchar(255) not null,	# range, exact, between
              #Indices
