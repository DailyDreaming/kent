# mafRef.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated mafRef.c and mafRef.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#High level information about a multiple alignment. Link to details in maf file.
