# snpSeq.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated snpSeq.c and snpSeq.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Information about sequences contained in rs_fasta files described in snpExtFile
CREATE TABLE snpSeq (
    name varchar(255) not null,	   # rsId of sequence
    chrom varchar(255) not null,   # Separate file per chrom
    file_offset bigint not null	   # byte offset of sequence in file
);
