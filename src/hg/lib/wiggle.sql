# wiggle.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated wiggle.c and wiggle.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Wiggle track values to display as y-values (first 6 fields are bed6)
