# trackChromScore.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated trackChromScore.c and trackChromScore.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Associate a track, a chromosome, and a score - used for MAF/AXT
CREATE TABLE trackChromScore (
    track varchar(255) not null,	# What track this is associated with
    chromosome varchar(255) not null,	# Chromosome name
    score double not null,	# Average score per base for chromosome.
              #Indices
    INDEX(track(32)),
    INDEX(chromosome(16))
