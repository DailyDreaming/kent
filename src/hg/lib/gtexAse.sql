# gtexAse.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated gtexAse.c and gtexAse.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#BED9+ with additional fields for ASE, coverage, and sample count
