# bacCloneXRef.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated bacCloneXRef.c and bacCloneXRef.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#BAC clones external names, internal sequence names and Genbank accessions
