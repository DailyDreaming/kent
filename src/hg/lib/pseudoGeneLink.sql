# pseudoGeneLink.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated pseudoGeneLink.c and pseudoGeneLink.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#links a gene/pseudogene prediction to an ortholog or paralog.
