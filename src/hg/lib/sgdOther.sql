# sgdOther.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated sgdOther.c and sgdOther.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Features other than coding genes from yeast genome database
