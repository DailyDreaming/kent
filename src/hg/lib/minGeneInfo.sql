# minGeneInfo.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated minGeneInfo.c and minGeneInfo.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Auxilliary info about a gene (less than the knownInfo)
CREATE TABLE minGeneInfo (
    name varchar(255) not null,	# gene name

    note varchar(255) not null,	# gene note
              #Indices
