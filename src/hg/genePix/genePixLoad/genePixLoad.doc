OVERVIEW OF .RA and .TAB FILES

The input to genePixLoad is a .ra file and a tab-separated file.
Both contain named values.  In the .ra file the name is the first
word of a line, and the rest of the line is the value.  Note that
blank lines are *not* allowed in the .ra file.   In the tab-separated
file the names of each column are contained in the first row,  which
should start with a '#' character, and then contain the column names
in a tab-separated manner.  Subsequent rows contain the values for
a particular image.  The program creates the database first by looking
for fields in the tab-separated file,  and then in the .ra file.

REQUIRED FIELD IN .RA FILE

contributor - A comma separate list of contributers.  Each contributer is of
    the form last name followed by initials.  There is a period, but no space
    after each initial.  Example:  Kent W.J., Haussler D., van Braun W.S.D

REQUIRED FIELD IN .TAB FILE

fileName - The name of the image file (not including directory).  

REQUIRED FIELDS THAT CAN BE IN EITHER FILE

fullDir - The directory where the full-sized version of image lives.
screenDir - Directory where the screen-sized version of image lives.
thumbDir - Directory where thumbnail-sized version of image lives.
taxon - NCBI taxon of organism in image.
isEmbryo - 1 if it's an embryo, 0 otherwise
age - days since birth (or since fertilization for embryo)
bodyPart - Name of part of body depicted in image.  Use "whole" for whole 
    mounts.  
sliceType - whole mount, sagittal, transverse, etc.
probeColor - color of probe
