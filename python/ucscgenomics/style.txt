Style Guide for Python Code

Naming Conventions

Packages and Modules
    All lowercase names, no spaces. Underscores if it would improve
readability in modules, but not for use in packages.

Classes
    CapitalCase names. Note the leading captial letter to distinguish between a
ClassName and a functionName. Underscores are not used, except for private
internal classes.

Functions
    mixedCase names. The leading character is not captialized, but all
successive words are capitalized. Underscores are not used.

Variables
    mixedCase names. Underscores are not to be used.

Constants
    ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORE used for names. No lowercase or leading
underscores.
